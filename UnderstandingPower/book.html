Preface</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This book brings
together the work of one of the most remarkable political activists
and thinkers of our time. The discussions span a wide array of
topics&mdash;from the workings of the modern media, to globalization,
the education system, environmental crises, the military-industrial
complex, activist strategies, and beyond&mdash;and present a
revolutionary perspective for evaluating the world, and for
understanding power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What distinguishes
Noam Chomsky&rsquo;s political thinking is not any one novel insight
or single overarching idea. In fact, Chomsky&rsquo;s political stance
is rooted in concepts that have been understood for centuries.
Rather, Chomsky&rsquo;s great contribution is his mastery of a huge
wealth of factual information, and his uncanny skill at unmasking, in
case after case, the workings and deceptions of powerful institutions
in today&rsquo;s world. His method involves teaching through
examples&mdash;not in the abstract&mdash;as a means of helping people
to learn how to think critically for themselves.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The opening chapter
introduces two themes that underlie nearly every aspect of the book:
the progress of activism in changing the world, and the role of the
media in staving off that activism and in shaping the way we think.
The book follows a roughly chronological order, and begins with four
discussions that took place in 1989 and 1990&mdash;the dawn of the
post-Cold War era. These first chapters lay a foundation for
Chomsky&rsquo;s subsequent analysis. The remaining chapters explore
more recent developments in U.S. foreign policy, international
economics, the domestic social and political environment, as well as
activist strategies and problems. The book and its accompanying
footnotes bring Chomsky&rsquo;s analysis right up to the present day.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The internet has
enabled us to place extensive documentation in our footnotes, which
appear at the book&rsquo;s website. These vast online notes go well
beyond mere citation to sources: they include commentary on the text,
excerpts from government documents, significant quotations from
newspaper articles and scholarship, and other important information.
Our goal was to make accessible much of the evidence supporting each
of Chomsky&rsquo;s factual assertions. The notes also add additional
depth for those interested in a given topic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The complete
footnotes&mdash;which are longer than the text itself&mdash;can be
easily downloaded from the book&rsquo;s website,
<font color="#0000ff"><u><b><a href="http://www.understandingpower.com/">www.understandingpower.com</a></b></u></font>
 (they can also be accessed through <font color="#0000ff"><u><a href="http://www.thenewpress.com/">www.thenewpress.com</a></u></font>).
Information about obtaining a bound printout of the notes is
available on the website, or by writing us in care of the publisher.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The book was put
together as follows. We transcribed tapes of dozens of
question-and-answer sessions, edited them for readability, then
reorganized and combined them to eliminate repetition and present the
analysis in a coherent progression of topics and ideas. Our aim was
to compile an overview of Chomsky&rsquo;s political thought that
combines the rigor and documentation of his scholarly books with the
accessibility of the interview format. Always we remained faithful to
Chomsky&rsquo;s own language and answers&mdash;and he reviewed the
text&mdash;but it was necessary to make superficial alterations for
structural and stylistic reasons.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Most of the material
is from seminar-style discussions with groups of activists, or from
question periods after public talks, held between 1989 and 1999. Some
of the answers in chapters 6, 7, 8 and 9 are taken from conversations
between Chomsky and Michael Albert. Questioners are identified as
&ldquo;Man&rdquo; or &ldquo;Woman&rdquo; because frequently this
device reveals when the same person is pursuing a line of
questioning, or whether somebody else has taken over.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We have personally
checked and verified the sources cited in the footnotes, except for
certain foreign language materials. Most of the sources are those
Chomsky relied upon when making his comments in the text, but some
are not. Emily Mitchell&rsquo;s assistance in retrieving reams of
this material in the final months of our work on this project was
invaluable. We direct readers to footnote 67 of chapter 1 for
discussion of one common misunderstanding regarding the footnotes:
that the frequent citation to articles from the mainstream media is
at odds with the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo; of the media, which
Chomsky outlines in chapter 1.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We want to thank our
parents&mdash;Emily and George Mitchell and Ron and Jone
Schoeffel&mdash;whose support made the book possible.</p>

Note on the Events of September 11, 2001</b></font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As this book was
going to print, hijacked airplanes hit the World Trade Center and
Pentagon, killing thousands and potentially triggering major
repercussions in U.S. society and in the world. The U.S. media
devoted huge coverage to the attacks and their aftermath. But,
overwhelmingly, the media omitted a critical, accurate discussion of
the context in which they occurred.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When President Bush
and U.S. officials announced that &ldquo;America was targeted for
attack because we&rsquo;re the brightest beacon for freedom and
opportunity in the world,&rdquo; the mainstream media in the U.S.
mostly echoed the refrains. A lead analysis in the <i>New York Times</i>
stated that the perpetrators had acted out of &ldquo;hatred for the
values cherished in the West as freedom, tolerance, prosperity,
religious pluralism and universal suffrage.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">1</font></sup>
Glaringly missing from the U.S. media&rsquo;s coverage was a full and
realistic account of U.S. foreign policy and its effects around the
world. It was hard to find anything but a passing mention of the
immense slaughter of Iraqi civilians during the Gulf War, the
devastation of Iraq&rsquo;s population by U.S.instigated sanctions
throughout the past decade, the U.S.&rsquo;s crucial role in
supporting Israel&rsquo;s 35-year occupation of Palestinian
territories, its support for brutal dictatorships throughout the
Middle East that repress the local populations, and on and on.
Similarly absent was any suggestion that U.S. foreign policy should
in fundamental ways be changed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This book was
compiled before the events of September 11, 2001. But answers to many
of the most important questions presented by those attacks will be
found here. Why does the media provide such a limited and uncritical
perspective, and such inaccurate analysis? What is the basis of U.S.
foreign policy and why does it engender such widespread hatred of the
U.S.? What can ordinary citizens do to change these situations?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As Chomsky noted
right after the attacks, &ldquo;The people in the advanced countries
now face a choice: we can express justified horror, or we can seek to
understand what may have led to the crimes. If we refuse to do the
latter, we will be contributing to the likelihood that much worse
lies ahead.&rdquo; From our frightening, current vantage point, the
discussions collected in this book seem more urgent than ever. We
hope that the book will provide a starting point for understanding,
and will contribute to the critical debates&mdash;and changes&mdash;that
must now occur.</p>

Achievements of Domestic Dissidence<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, I
think the reason we&rsquo;ve all come out here to spend the weekend
talking with you is to get some of your perspectives on the state of
the world, and what we can do to change it. I&rsquo;m wondering, do
you think activism has brought about many changes in the U.S.A. in
the past few decades?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Oh sure, big changes
actually. I don&rsquo;t think the structure of the <i>institutions</i>
has been changed&mdash;but you can see real changes in the culture,
and in a lot of other ways too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance,
compare two Presidential administrations in the 1960s and 1980s, the
Kennedy administration and the Reagan administration. Now, in a sense
they had a lot in common, contrary to what everyone says. Both came
into office on fraudulent denunciations of their predecessors as
being wimpish and weak and letting the Russians get ahead of us&mdash;there
was a fraudulent &ldquo;missile gap&rdquo; in the Kennedy case, a
fraudulent &ldquo;window of vulnerability&rdquo; in the Reagan case.
Both were characterized by a major escalation of the arms race, which
means more international violence and increased taxpayer subsidies to
advanced industry at home through military spending. Both were
jingoist, both tried to whip up fear in the general population
through a lot of militarist hysteria and jingoism. Both launched
highly aggressive foreign policies around the world&mdash;Kennedy
substantially increased the level of violence in Latin America; the
plague of repression that culminated in the 1980s under Reagan was in
fact largely a result of his initiatives. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Of course, the
Kennedy administration <i>was</i> different in that, at least
rhetorically, and to some extent in practice, it was concerned for
social reform programs at home, whereas the Reagan administration was
committed to the opposite, to eliminating what there was of a social
welfare system here. But that probably reflects the difference in
international affairs in the two periods more than anything else. In
the early 1960s, the United States was the world-dominant power, and
had plenty of opportunity for combining international violence and
commitment to military spending with social reform at home. By the
1980s, that same opportunity wasn&rsquo;t around anymore: the United
States was just not that powerful and not that rich relative to its
industrial rivals&mdash;in absolute terms it was, but not relatively.
And there was a general consensus among elites, it wasn&rsquo;t just
Reagan, that you had to break down the welfare state in order to
maintain the profitability and competitiveness of American capital.
But that difference apart, the two administrations were very similar.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
they couldn&rsquo;t <i>do</i> the same things. So for example,
Kennedy could invade Cuba and launch the world&rsquo;s to-date major
international terrorist operation against them&mdash;which went on
for years, probably still is going on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">2</font></sup>
He was able to invade South Vietnam, which he did after all: Kennedy
sent the American Air Force to bomb and napalm South Vietnam and
defoliate the country, and he sent troops to crush the peasant
independence movement there.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">3</font></sup>
And Vietnam&rsquo;s an area of minor American concern, it&rsquo;s way
on the other end of the world. The Reagan administration tried to do
similar things much closer to home in Central America, and couldn&rsquo;t.
As soon as they started moving towards direct intervention in Central
America in the first few months of the administration in 1981, they
had to back off and move to clandestine operations&mdash;secret arms
sales, covert funding through client states, training of terrorist
forces like the contras in Nicaragua, and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">4</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s a very
striking difference, a dramatic difference. And I think that
difference is one of the achievements of the activism and dissidence
of the last twenty-five years. In fact, the Reagan administration was
forced to create a major propaganda office, the Office of Public
Diplomacy: it&rsquo;s not the first one in American history, it&rsquo;s
the second, the first was during the Wilson administration in 1917.
But this one was much larger, much more extensive, it was a major
effort at indoctrinating the public.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">5</font></sup>
The Kennedy administration never had to do that, because they could
trust that the population would be supportive of any form of violence
and aggression they decided to carry out. That&rsquo;s a big change,
and it&rsquo;s had its effects. There were no B-52s in Central
America in the 1980s. It was bad enough, hundreds of thousands of
people were slaughtered&mdash;but if we&rsquo;d sent B-52s and the
82nd Airborne, it would have been a lot worse. And that&rsquo;s a
reflection of a serious rise in domestic dissidence and activism in
the United States over the past twenty-five years. The Reagan
administration was forced into clandestine tactics rather than direct
aggression of the sort that Kennedy  was able to use in Vietnam,
largely in order to pacify the domestic population. As soon as Reagan
indicated that he might try to turn to direct military intervention
in Central America, there was a convulsion in the country, ranging
from a massive flow of letters, to demonstrations, to church groups
getting involved; people started coming out of the woodwork all over
the place. And the administration immediately backed off.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, the Reagan
military budget had to level off by 1985. It did spurt, pretty much
along the lines of Carter administration projections, but then it
leveled off at about what it would have been if Carter had stayed
in.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">6</font></sup> Well,
why did that happen? Partly it happened because of fiscal problems
arising after four years of catastrophic Reaganite deficit spending,
but partly it was just because there was a lot of domestic
dissidence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And by now that
dissidence is kind of irrepressible, actually. The fact that it
doesn&rsquo;t have a center, and doesn&rsquo;t have a source, and
doesn&rsquo;t have an organizational structure, that has both
strengths and weaknesses. The weaknesses are that people get the
sense that they&rsquo;re alone&mdash;because you don&rsquo;t see
things happening down the street. And it&rsquo;s possible to maintain
the illusion that there&rsquo;s no activism going on, because there&rsquo;s
nothing dramatically visible, like huge demonstrations or something;
occasionally there are, but not most of the time. And there&rsquo;s
very little in the way of inter-communication, so all sorts of
organizing can be happening in parallel, but it doesn&rsquo;t feed
into itself and move on from there. Those are all weaknesses. On the
other hand, the strength is, it&rsquo;s very hard to crush&mdash;because
there&rsquo;s nothing to cut off: if one thing gets eliminated,
something else just comes up to take its place.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So looking over a
long stretch, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s true that things have
gotten more passive, more quiescent, more indoctrinated and so on. In
fact, if anything, it&rsquo;s the opposite. But it&rsquo;s sort of
neither more nor less, really, it&rsquo;s just different.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And you can see it
in all kinds of ways. I mean, public opposition to the policies of
the Reagan administration kept rising&mdash;it was always very high,
and it rose through the Eighties.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">7</font></sup>
Or take the media: there have been slight changes, there&rsquo;s more
openness. It&rsquo;s easier for dissidents to get access to the media
today than it was twenty years ago. It&rsquo;s not <i>easy,</i> like
it&rsquo;s 0.2 percent instead of 0.1 percent, but it is different.
And in fact, by now there are even people <i>inside</i> the
institutions who came out of the culture and experiences of the
Sixties, and have worked their way into the media, universities,
publishing firms, the political system to some extent. That&rsquo;s
had an effect as well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take something
like the human rights policies of the Carter administration. Now,
they weren&rsquo;t <i>from</i> the Carter administration really, they
were from Congress&mdash;they were Congressional human rights
programs which the Carter administration was forced to adapt to, to a
limited extent. And they&rsquo;ve been maintained through the 1980s
as well: the Reagan administration had to adapt to them somewhat too.
And they&rsquo;ve had an effect. They&rsquo;re  used very cynically
and hypocritically, we know all that stuff&mdash;but nevertheless,
there are plenty of people whose lives have been saved by them. Well,
where did those programs come from? Where they came from, if you
trace it back, is kids from the 1960s who became Congressional
assistants and pressed for drafting of legislation&mdash;using
popular pressures from here, there and the other place to help them
through. Their proposals worked their way through a couple of
Congressional offices, and finally found their way into Congressional
legislation.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">8</font></sup>
New human rights organizations developed at the same time, like Human
Rights Watch. And out of it all came at least a rhetorical commitment
to putting human rights issues in the forefront of foreign policy
concerns. And that&rsquo;s not without an effect. It&rsquo;s cynical,
doubtless&mdash;you can show it. But still it&rsquo;s had an effect.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8522_2032848809"></a>The
U.S. Network of Terrorist Mercenary States<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: It&rsquo;s
curious that you&rsquo;re saying that, because I certainly didn&rsquo;t
have that impression. The only human rights issue the Reagan
administration seemed to be concerned with was that of the Soviet
Jews&mdash;I mean, they resumed funding the terror in Guatemala.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But note how they
did it: they had to sneak it in around the back. In fact, there was
more funding of Guatemala under Carter than there was under Reagan,
though it&rsquo;s not very well known. See, the Carter administration
was compelled to stop sending military aid to Guatemala by
Congressional legislation in 1977, and officially they did&mdash;but
if you look at the Pentagon records, funding continued until around
1980 or &rsquo;81 at just about the normal level, by various forms of
trickery: you know, &ldquo;things were in the pipeline,&rdquo; that
kind of business. This was never talked about in the press, but if
you look at the records, you&rsquo;ll see the funding was still going
through until that time.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">9</font></sup>
The Reagan administration had to stop sending it altogether&mdash;and
in fact, what they did was turn to mercenary states.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, one of the
interesting features of the 1980s is that to a large extent the
United States had to carry out its foreign interventions through the
medium of mercenary states. There&rsquo;s a whole network of U.S.
mercenary states. Israel is the major one, but it also includes
Taiwan, South Africa, South Korea, the states that are involved in
the World Anti-Communist League and the various military groups that
unite the Western Hemisphere, Saudi Arabia to fund it, Panama&mdash;Noriega
was right in the center of the thing. We caught a glimpse of it in
things like the Oliver North trial and the Iran-contra hearings
[Oliver North was tried in 1989 for his role in &ldquo;Irancontra,&rdquo;
the U.S. government&rsquo;s illegal scheme to fund the Nicaraguan
&ldquo;contra&rdquo; militias in their war against Nicaragua&rsquo;s
left-wing government by covertly selling weapons to Iran]&mdash;they&rsquo;re
international terrorist networks of mercenary states. It&rsquo;s a
new phenomenon in world history, way beyond  what anybody has ever
dreamt of. Other countries hire terrorists, we hire terrorist states,
we&rsquo;re a big, powerful country.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, one
significant thing came up in the North trial, to my surprise&mdash;I
didn&rsquo;t think anything was going to come up. One interesting
thing was put on the record, this famous 42-page document that they
referred to; I don&rsquo;t know if any of you saw that.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">10</font></sup>
See, the government would not allow secret documents to appear, but
they did permit a summary to appear, which the judge presented to the
jury saying, &ldquo;You can take this to be fact, we don&rsquo;t
question it anymore because it&rsquo;s authorized by the government.&rdquo;
That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s not disinformation, incidentally;
it means that this is what the government was willing to say is the
truth, whether it&rsquo;s true or not is another question. But this
42-page document is kind of interesting. It outlines a <i>massive</i>
international terrorist network run by the United States. It lists
the countries that were involved, the ways we got them involved. All
of it is focused on one thing in this case, the war in Nicaragua. But
there were plenty of other operations going on, and if you expanded
it to look at, say, Angola, and Afghanistan, and others, you&rsquo;d
bring in more pieces. One of the main players is Israel: they&rsquo;ve
helped the United States penetrate black Africa, they&rsquo;ve helped
support the genocide in Guatemala; when the United States couldn&rsquo;t
directly involve itself with the military dictatorships of the
southern cone in South America, Israel did it for us.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">11</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s very valuable to have a mercenary state like that around
which is militarily advanced and technologically competent.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is,
what was the need to develop this huge international terrorist
network involving mercenary states? It&rsquo;s that the U.S.
government couldn&rsquo;t intervene directly whenever it wanted to
anymore, so it had to do it in what amounted to quite inefficient
ways. It&rsquo;s a lot more efficient to do what Kennedy did, and
what Johnson did&mdash;just send in the Marines. That&rsquo;s
efficient, it&rsquo;s an efficient killing-machine, it&rsquo;s not
going to be exposed and put a crimp in the works, you don&rsquo;t
have to do it around the corners. So you&rsquo;re right: the Reagan
administration <i>did</i> support Guatemala&mdash;but indirectly.
They had to get Israeli advisers in there, and Taiwanese
counterinsurgency agents and so on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Just to take one
example of this, the Chief of Intelligence for the F.D.N., the main
contra force in Nicaragua, defected about six months ago, a guy named
Horacio Arce; he&rsquo;s the most important defector yet. This was of
course never reported in the United States, but he was very widely
interviewed in Mexico. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">12</font></sup>
And he had a lot of things to say, including details of his own
training. He had been brought illegally to Eglin Air Force base in
Florida, and he described in detail what the training was like there
and then in San Salvador where he was sent for paratroop practice.
The trainers were from all over the place: they had Spanish trainers,
plenty of Israeli trainers, Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Taiwanese,
Dominicans, separate Japanese trainers for the Misquito Indian
recruits&mdash;they&rsquo;ve got a huge operation running. And it&rsquo;s
all clandestine, and all obviously illegal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And it&rsquo;s
lethal alright. I mean, in Guatemala alone maybe a hundred thousand
people were killed during the 1980s, and the popular movements were
decimated.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">13</font></sup>
But lethal as it is, it would have been a lot worse without the
restrictions that have been imposed by U.S. domestic dissidence in
the last twenty-five years. I think that&rsquo;s the important point.
If you want to measure the achievement of the popular movements here,
you have to ask, what would things have been like if they hadn&rsquo;t
been around? And things would have been like South Vietnam in the
Sixties&mdash;when the country was wiped out, and may never recover.
And remember, Central America&rsquo;s a much more significant concern
for the United States than Vietnam: there&rsquo;s a historical
commitment to controlling it, it&rsquo;s our own backyard, and
American business wants it as the equivalent of what East Asia is to
Japan, a cheap labor area for exploitation. Yet the Reagan
administration was unable to intervene there at the level that
Kennedy did in an area of marginal American concern, Vietnam. That&rsquo;s
a big change, and I think it&rsquo;s primarily attributable to the
domestic dissidence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">After all, what are
the Iran-contra hearings about? What they&rsquo;re about is the fact
that the government was driven underground. Well, why was the
government driven underground, why didn&rsquo;t they just come out
and do everything up front? They couldn&rsquo;t. They couldn&rsquo;t
because they were afraid of their own population. And that&rsquo;s
significant, you know. It&rsquo;s very rare that a government has had
to go this deep underground in order to carry out its terrorist
activities. It&rsquo;s an unusual situation; I don&rsquo;t even think
there&rsquo;s a historical precedent.</p>

Third World Governments<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: The
Allende coup in Chile&mdash;that wasn&rsquo;t above ground. [Chilean
President Salvador Allende was overthrown in a coup engineered by the
C.I.A. in 1973.]</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Allende thing
was underground, that&rsquo;s true&mdash;but that was a one-shot
affair. And even there, notice that it was done in a different style:
it was done in the classic style, it was like the Iran side of the
Iran-contra affair. See, there&rsquo;s a classic technique when you
want to overthrow a government: you arm its military. That&rsquo;s
the standard thing, for obvious reasons. You want to overthrow a
government, who&rsquo;s going to overthrow it for you? Well, the
military, they&rsquo;re the guys who overthrow governments. In fact,
that&rsquo;s the main reason for giving military aid and training all
around the world in the first place, to keep contacts with our guys
in the place that counts, the army.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you read American
secret documents, this is all stated very openly, actually. For
example, there&rsquo;s a now-declassified Robert McNamara [Secretary
of Defense]-to-McGeorge Bundy [Special Assistant to the President for
 National Security Affairs] intercommunication from 1965 with a
detailed discussion of Latin America, in which they talk about how
the role of the military in Latin American societies is to overthrow
civilian governments if, in the judgment of the military, the
governments are not pursuing the &ldquo;welfare of the nation,&rdquo;
which turns out to be the welfare of American multinational
corporations. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">14</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So if you want to
overthrow a government, you arm its military, and of course you make
it hard for the civilian government to function. And that&rsquo;s
what was done in the Chile case: we armed the military, we tried to
cause economic chaos, and the military took over.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">15</font></sup>
Okay, that&rsquo;s sort of classic. In fact, that&rsquo;s almost
certainly what the Iran part of the Iran-contra affair was about. The
arms shipments to the Iranian military didn&rsquo;t have anything to
do with a secret deal to release American hostages [held by
pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon beginning in 1985], and they didn&rsquo;t
have anything to do with &ldquo;October Surprises&rdquo; either, in
my view [theory that the Reagan electoral campaign secretly promised
arms to Iran if Iran delayed the release of earlier U.S. hostages
until after the 1980 Presidential election]. What they had to do with
was the classic device of arming the military so they would carry out
a coup and restore the old arrangement that existed under the Shah.
There&rsquo;s very good evidence for this; I can talk about it if you
like. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">16</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But Chile was a
straight, classic operation&mdash;clandestine in a sense, but not all
that clandestine. For instance, arming the Chilean military was
completely public: it was in public records, it was never secret. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">17</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s just that nobody in the United States ever looks, because
the media and the intellectual class are too disciplined, and
ordinary people out there don&rsquo;t have the time to go and read
Pentagon records and figure out what happened. So it was clandestine
in the sense that nobody knew about it, but the information was all
available in public records, there was nothing hidden about it. In
fact, Chile was kind of a normal C.I.A. operation, it was like
overthrowing Sukarno in Indonesia [in a 1965 U.S.-backed coup].<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">18</font></sup>
There were some clandestine parts to it&mdash;and there are parts
that still haven&rsquo;t come out yet&mdash;but it was not really
deep covert action. And it was nothing like the Central American
activities of the 1980s, they&rsquo;re just radically different in
scale.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, there <i>have</i>
been clandestine operations&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to suggest that
it&rsquo;s novel. Like, overthrowing the government of Iran in 1953
was clandestine.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">19</font></sup>
Overthrowing the government of Guatemala in 1954 was clandestine&mdash;and
it was kept secret for twenty years. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">20</font></sup>
Operation MONGOOSE, which so far wins the prize as the world&rsquo;s
leading single international terrorist operation, started by the
Kennedy administration right after the Bay of Pigs, that was secret.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Which one
was that?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Operation MONGOOSE.
Right after the Bay of Pigs invasion attempt failed, Kennedy launched
a major terrorist operation against Cuba [beginning  November 30,
1961]. It was huge&mdash;I think it had a $50 million-a-year budget
(that&rsquo;s known); it had about twenty-five hundred employees,
about five hundred of them American, about two thousand what they
call &ldquo;assets,&rdquo; you know, Cuban exiles or one thing or
another. It was launched from Florida&mdash;and it was totally
illegal. I mean, international law we can&rsquo;t even talk about,
but even by domestic law it was illegal, because it was a C.I.A.
operation taking place on American territory, which is illegal.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">21</font></sup>
And it was serious: it involved blowing up hotels, sinking fishing
boats, blowing up industrial installations, bombing airplanes. This
was a very serious terrorist operation. The part of it that became
well known was the assassination attempts&mdash;there were eight
known assassination attempts on Castro.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">22</font></sup>
A lot of this stuff came out in the Senate Church Committee hearings
in 1975, and other parts were uncovered through some good
investigative reporting. It may still be going on today (we usually
find out about these things a few years later), but it certainly went
on through the 1970s.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">23</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, let me
just tell you one piece of it that was revealed about a year ago. It
turns out that Operation MONGOOSE practically blew up the world. I
don&rsquo;t know how many of you have been following the new material
that&rsquo;s been released on the Cuban Missile Crisis [1962
U.S.-Soviet showdown over Soviet missiles in Cuba], but it&rsquo;s
very interesting. There have been meetings with the Russians, now
there are some with the Cubans, and a lot of material has come out
under the Freedom of Information Act here. And there&rsquo;s a very
different picture of the Cuban Missile Crisis emerging.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One thing that&rsquo;s
been discovered is that the Russians and the Cubans had separate
agendas during the course of the Crisis. See, the standard view is
that the Cubans were just Russian puppets. Well, that&rsquo;s not
true, nothing like that is ever true&mdash;it may be convenient to
believe, but it&rsquo;s never true. And in fact, the Cubans had their
own concerns: they were worried about an American invasion. And now
it turns out that those concerns were very valid&mdash;the United
States had invasion plans for October 1962; the Missile Crisis was in
October 1962. In fact, American naval and military units were already
being deployed for an invasion before the beginning of the Missile
Crisis; that&rsquo;s just been revealed in Freedom of Information Act
materials.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">24</font></sup>
Of course, it&rsquo;s always been denied here, like if you read
McGeorge Bundy&rsquo;s book on the military system, he denies it, but
it&rsquo;s true, and now the documents are around to prove it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">25</font></sup>
And the Cubans doubtless knew it, so that was probably what was
motivating them. The Russians, on the other hand, were worried about
the enormous missile gap&mdash;which was in fact in the U.S.&rsquo;s
favor, not in their favor as Kennedy claimed.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">26</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So what happened is,
there was that famous interchange between Kennedy and Khrushchev, in
which an agreement to end the crisis was reached. Then shortly after
that, the Russians tried to take control of their missiles in Cuba,
in order to carry through the deal they had made with the United
States. See, at that point the Russians didn&rsquo;t actually control
the missiles, the missiles were in the hands of Cubans&mdash;and the
Cubans didn&rsquo;t want to give them up, because they were still
worried, plausibly, that there would be an American invasion. So
there was a stand-off between them early in November&mdash;which even
included an actual confrontation between Russian and Cuban forces
about who was going to have physical control of the missiles. It was
a very tense moment, and you didn&rsquo;t know what was going to
happen. Then right in the middle of it, one of the Operation MONGOOSE
activities took place. Right at one of the tensest moments of the
Missile Crisis, the C.I.A. blew up a factory in Cuba, with about four
hundred people killed according to the Cubans. Well, fortunately the
Cubans didn&rsquo;t react&mdash;but if something like that had
happened to <i>us</i> at the time, Kennedy certainly would have
reacted, and we would have had a nuclear war. It came very close.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, there&rsquo;s
a terrorist operation which might have set off a nuclear war. That
wasn&rsquo;t even reported in the United States when the information
was released about a year ago, it was considered so insignificant.
The only two places where you can find it reported are in a footnote,
on another topic actually, in one of these national security
journals, <i>International Security,</i> and also in a pretty
interesting book by one of the top State Department intelligence
specialists, Raymond Garthoff, who&rsquo;s a sensible guy. He has a
book called <i>Reflections on the Cuban Missile Crisis,</i> and he
brings in some of this material. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">27</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, other
things have been revealed about the Crisis which are absolutely
startling. For instance, it turns out that the head of the U.S. Air
Force at the time, General Thomas Power, without consultation with
the government&mdash;in fact, without even <i>informing</i> the
government&mdash;raised the level of American national security alert
to the second highest level [on October 24, 1962]. See, there&rsquo;s
a series of levels of alert for U.S. military forces: it&rsquo;s
called &ldquo;Defense Condition&rdquo; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Usually you&rsquo;re
at &ldquo;5&rdquo;; nothing&rsquo;s going on. Then the President can
say, &ldquo;You can move up to &lsquo;3,&rsquo; &rdquo; which means,
get the Strategic Air Command bombers in the air, or &ldquo;Go up to
&lsquo;2,&rsquo; &rdquo; which means you&rsquo;re ready to shoot,
then you&rsquo;re at &ldquo;1,&rdquo; and you send them off. Well,
this guy just raised the level of alert unilaterally.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, when you raise
the level of alert, the point is to inform the Russians and to inform
the other major powers what you&rsquo;re doing, because they know
something&rsquo;s happening&mdash;they can see what you&rsquo;re
doing, they can see the S.A.C. bombers going up and the ships getting
deployed: this stuff is all <i>meant</i> to be seen. So one of the
top U.S. generals openly raised the level of security alert to just
before nuclear war right in the middle of the Missile Crisis, and
didn&rsquo;t inform Washington&mdash;the Secretary of Defense didn&rsquo;t
even know about it. The <i>Russian</i> Secretary of Defense knew it,
because his intelligence was picking it up, but Washington didn&rsquo;t
know. And this general did it just out of, you know, snubbing his
nose at the Russians. The fact that this happened was just released
about a year ago. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">28</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: At that
point, did the Russians go up to the next level too?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, they didn&rsquo;t
react. See, we would have seen if they&rsquo;d reacted, and Kennedy
probably would have shot off the missiles. But Khrushchev didn&rsquo;t
react. In fact, throughout this whole period the Russians were very
passive, they never reacted much&mdash;because they were scared. The
fact is, the United States had an enormous preponderance of military
force. I mean, the U.S. military thought there was no real problem:
they <i>wanted</i> a war, because they figured we&rsquo;d just wipe
the Russians out.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">29</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: But are
you saying that the U.S. intentionally created the Cuban Missile
Crisis?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I&rsquo;m not
quite saying that. These are things that happened in the course of
the Crisis&mdash;how we got to it is a little different. It came
about when the Russians put missiles on Cuba and the United States
observed that missiles were going in and didn&rsquo;t want to allow
them there. But of course, there&rsquo;s a background, as there
always is to everything, and part of the background is that the
United States was planning to invade Cuba at the time, and the
Russians knew it, and the Cubans knew it. The Americans didn&rsquo;t
know it&mdash;I mean, the American <i>people</i> didn&rsquo;t know
it. In fact, even a lot of the American government didn&rsquo;t know
it; it was only at a very top level that it was known.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8526_2032848809"></a>Government
Secrecy<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There&rsquo;s a
point here to be made about government secrecy, actually: government
secrecy is not for security reasons, overwhelmingly&mdash;it&rsquo;s
just to prevent the population here from knowing what&rsquo;s going
on. I mean, a lot of secret internal documents get declassified after
thirty years or so, and if you look over the entire long record of
them, there&rsquo;s virtually nothing in there that ever had any
security-related concern. I don&rsquo;t know if Stephen Zunes [a
professor in the audience], who&rsquo;s just done a dissertation on a
lot of this stuff, would agree, but my impression from reading the
secret record over a wide range of areas is that you virtually never
find anything in there that had any connection to security
whatsoever. The main purpose of secrecy is just to make sure that the
general population here doesn&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>STEPHEN ZUNES: I
concur completely.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, that&rsquo;s
your impression too? And you know, I&rsquo;m at M.I.T., so I&rsquo;m
always talking to the scientists who work on missiles for the
Pentagon and so on, and these guys also don&rsquo;t see any reason
for it. Like, Stark Draper,  who runs the big missile lab at M.I.T.
and who invented inertial guidance and so on, says publicly, and he&rsquo;s
told me privately, that he doesn&rsquo;t see any purpose in security
classifications&mdash;because he says the only effect is to prevent
American scientists from communicating adequately. As far as he&rsquo;s
concerned, you can take the instruction book for building the most
advanced missiles and just give it to China or Russia, he doesn&rsquo;t
care. First of all, he says they can&rsquo;t do anything with it,
because they don&rsquo;t have the technological and industrial level
that would enable them to do anything. And if they <i>did</i> have
that level, they&rsquo;d have invented it too, so you&rsquo;re not
telling them anything. All you&rsquo;re doing is making it harder for
American scientists to communicate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As for the secret
diplomatic record, it&rsquo;s difficult to think of anything that has
been released that was ever a secret which actually involved
security&mdash;they involve marginalizing the population, that&rsquo;s
what government secrets are for.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: You could
apply that insight to the Rosenberg trial in the 1950s&mdash;they
were supposed to have endangered the world by selling the Russians
nuclear secrets. [Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed for
treason by the U.S. government in 1953.]</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah&mdash;the
Rosenberg execution had nothing to do with national security; it was
part of trying to destroy the political movements of the Thirties. If
you want to traumatize people, treason trials are an extreme way&mdash;if
there are spies running around in our midst, then we&rsquo;re really
in trouble, we&rsquo;d better just listen to the government and stop
thinking.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, every
government has a need to frighten its population, and one way of
doing that is to shroud its workings in mystery. The idea that a
government has to be shrouded in mystery is something that goes back
to Herodotus [ancient Greek historian]. You read Herodotus, and he
describes how the Medes and others won their freedom by struggle, and
then they lost their freedom when the institution of royalty was
invented to create a cloak of mystery around power.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">30</font></sup>
See, the idea behind royalty was that there&rsquo;s this other
species of individuals who are beyond the norm and who the people are
not supposed to understand. That&rsquo;s the standard way you cloak
and protect power: you make it look mysterious and secret, above the
ordinary person&mdash;otherwise why should anybody accept it? Well,
they&rsquo;re willing to accept it out of fear that some great
enemies are about to destroy them, and because of that they&rsquo;ll
cede their authority to the Lord, or the King, or the President or
something, just to protect themselves. That&rsquo;s the way
governments work&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way <i>any</i> system of
power works&mdash;and the secrecy system is part of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Clandestine terror
is a different part of it&mdash;if the public will not support direct
intervention and violence, then you have to keep it secret from them
somehow. So in a way, I think the scale of clandestine government
activities  is a pretty good measure of the popular dissidence and
activism in a country&mdash;and clandestine activities shot way up
during the Reagan period. That tells you something right there about
popular &ldquo;empowerment&rdquo;: it&rsquo;s a reflection of
people&rsquo;s power that the government was forced underground.
That&rsquo;s a victory, you know.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Doesn&rsquo;t
seem like much of a victory.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it depends
what you look at. If you look at 200,000 corpses in Central America,
it doesn&rsquo;t seem like much of a victory. But if you look at ten
million people who are still alive, it does seem like a victory. It
depends where you&rsquo;re looking. You don&rsquo;t win what you&rsquo;d
like to win, but you could have lost a lot more.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For example, take El
Salvador in the 1980s. The purpose of U.S. policies there was to wipe
out the popular organizations and support a traditional Latin
American-style regime that would ensure the kind of business climate
we expect in the region. So the independent press was destroyed, the
political opposition was murdered, priests and labor organizers were
murdered, and so on and so forth&mdash;and U.S. planners figured they
had the problem licked. Well, today it&rsquo;s right back, it&rsquo;s
right back where it was. New people came up, the organizations are
forming again. It&rsquo;s at a lower level, of course, because
there&rsquo;s been so much destruction, but they&rsquo;re right back.
That wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if we&rsquo;d sent in B-52s and the
82nd Airborne. So there is kind of a margin for survival in the Third
World that relates to the degree of American dissidence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take the
hurricane in Nicaragua [in October 1988]. Well, it was devastating,
the country may not survive in fact. But the possibility of survival
will come from American dissidents. I mean, there&rsquo;s been a
tremendous amount of hurricane relief raised&mdash;Quest for Peace,
which is a dozen people at a Jesuit Center in Hyattsville, Maryland,
has raised several million dollars in hurricane relief all by
themselves, without any funds or any outreach, no media, nothing.
Raising several million dollars with no resources is not easy&mdash;try
it sometime. But that can be done because there&rsquo;s a large part
of the American population which is just out of the system: they
don&rsquo;t believe what the government tells them, they don&rsquo;t
accept anything; they may not have any organization or any media or
anything like that, but they&rsquo;re there, and they can be reached,
by letter if nothing else. And that can provide a kind of margin for
survival in the Third World.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8528_2032848809"></a>The
Media: An Institutional Analysis<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You
mentioned the media being only slightly open to dissidents. I&rsquo;m
wondering how long it has been the case that the American government
and other powerful interests in the country could count on the
participation  of the major media when it comes to framing topics and
reporting issues more or less the way they want them reported?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you know, I
haven&rsquo;t looked at the entire history, but I would guess since
about 1775.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: That long?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you look back at
the Revolutionary War period, you&rsquo;ll find that Revolutionary
War leaders, people like Thomas Jefferson (who&rsquo;s regarded as a
great libertarian, and with some reason), were saying that people
should be punished if they are, in his words, &ldquo;traitors in
thought but not in deed&rdquo;&mdash;meaning they should be punished
if they <i>say</i> things that are treacherous, or even if they <i>think</i>
things that are treacherous. And during the Revolutionary War, there
was vicious repression of dissident opinion.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">31</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it just goes
on from there. Today the methods are different&mdash;now it&rsquo;s
not the threat of force that ensures the media will present things
within a framework that serves the interests of the dominant
institutions, the mechanisms today are much more subtle. But
nevertheless, there is a complex system of filters in the media and
educational institutions which ends up ensuring that dissident
perspectives are weeded out, or marginalized in one way or another.
And the end result is in fact quite similar: what are called opinions
&ldquo;on the left&rdquo; and &ldquo;on the right&rdquo; in the media
represent only a limited spectrum of debate, which reflects the range
of needs of private power&mdash;but there&rsquo;s essentially nothing
beyond those &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; positions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So what the media
do, in effect, is to take the set of assumptions which express the
basic ideas of the propaganda system, whether about the Cold War or
the economic system or the &ldquo;national interest&rdquo; and so on,
and then present a range of debate <i>within</i> that framework&mdash;so
the debate only enhances the strength of the assumptions, ingraining
them in people&rsquo;s minds as the entire possible spectrum of
opinion that there is. So you see, in our system what you might call
&ldquo;state propaganda&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t expressed as such, as it
would be in a totalitarian society&mdash;rather it&rsquo;s implicit,
it&rsquo;s presupposed, it provides the framework for debate among
the people who are admitted into mainstream discussion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, the nature
of Western systems of indoctrination is typically not understood by
dictators, they don&rsquo;t understand the utility for propaganda
purposes of having &ldquo;critical debate&rdquo; that incorporates
the basic assumptions of the official doctrines, and thereby
marginalizes and eliminates authentic and rational critical
discussion. Under what&rsquo;s sometimes been called &ldquo;brainwashing
under freedom,&rdquo; the critics, or at least, the &ldquo;responsible
critics&rdquo; make a major contribution to the cause by bounding the
debate within certain acceptable limits&mdash;that&rsquo;s why
they&rsquo;re tolerated, and in fact even honored.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But what
exactly are these &ldquo;filters&rdquo; that create this
situation&mdash;how does it actually work that really challenging
positions are weeded out of the media?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, to begin with,
there are various layers and components to the American media&mdash;the
<i>National Enquirer</i> that you pick up in the supermarket is not
the same as the <i>Washington Post</i>, for example. But if you want
to talk about presentation of news and information, the basic
structure is that there are what are sometimes called
&ldquo;agenda-setting&rdquo; media: there are a number of major media
outlets that end up setting a basic framework that other smaller
media units more or less have to adapt to. The larger media have the
essential resources, and other smaller media scattered around the
country pretty much have to take the framework which the major
outlets present and adapt to it&mdash;because if the newspapers in
Pittsburgh or Salt Lake City want to know about Angola, say, very few
of them are going to be able to send their own correspondents and
have their own analysts and so on. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">32</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, if you look at
these larger media outlets, they have some crucial features in
common. First of all, the agenda-setting institutions are big
corporations; in fact, they&rsquo;re mega-corporations, which are
highly profitable&mdash;and for the most part they&rsquo;re also
linked into even bigger conglomerates.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">33</font></sup>
And they, like other corporations, have a product to sell and a
market they want to sell it to: the product is audiences, and the
market is advertisers. So the economic structure of a newspaper is
that it sells readers to other businesses. See, they&rsquo;re not
really trying to sell newspapers to people&mdash;in fact, very often
a journal that&rsquo;s in financial trouble will try to cut <i>down</i>
its circulation, and what they&rsquo;ll try to do is up-scale their
readership, because that increases advertising rates.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">34</font></sup>
So what they&rsquo;re doing is selling audiences to other businesses,
and for the agenda-setting media like the <i>New York Times</i> and
the <i>Washington Post</i> and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>,
they&rsquo;re in fact selling very privileged, elite audiences to
other businesses&mdash;overwhelmingly their readers are members of
the so-called &ldquo;political class,&rdquo; which is the class that
makes decisions in our society.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, imagine that
you&rsquo;re an intelligent Martian looking down at this system. What
you see is big corporations selling relatively privileged audiences
in the decision-making classes to other businesses. Now you ask, what
picture of the world do you expect to come out of this arrangement?
Well, a plausible answer is, one that puts forward points of view and
political perspectives which satisfy the needs and the interests and
the perspectives of the buyers, the sellers, and the market. I mean,
it would be pretty surprising if that <i>weren&rsquo;t</i> the case.
So I don&rsquo;t call this a &ldquo;theory&rdquo; or anything like
that&mdash;it&rsquo;s virtually just an observation. What Ed Herman
and I called the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo; in our book on the
media [<i>Manufacturing Consent</i> ] is really just a kind of
truism&mdash;it just says that you&rsquo;d expect institutions to
work in their own interests, because if they didn&rsquo;t they
wouldn&rsquo;t be  able to function for very long. So I think that
the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo; is primarily useful just as a tool
to help us think about the media&mdash;it&rsquo;s really not much
deeper than that.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">35</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8530_2032848809"></a>Testing
the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo;<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Could you
give us kind of a thumbnail sketch of how you&rsquo;ve used that
tool?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, essentially in
<i>Manufacturing Consent</i> what we were doing was contrasting two
models: how the media <i>ought</i> to function, and how they <i>do</i>
function. The former model is the more or less conventional one: it&rsquo;s
what the <i>New York Times</i> recently referred to in a book review
as the &ldquo;traditional Jeffersonian role of the media as a
counter-weight to government&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, a
cantankerous, obstinate, ubiquitous press, which must be suffered by
those in authority in order to preserve the right of the people to
know, and to help the population assert meaningful control over the
political process.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">36</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s the standard conception of the media in the United
States, and it&rsquo;s what most of the people in the media
themselves take for granted. The alternative conception is that the
media will present a picture of the world which defends and
inculcates the economic, social, and political agendas of the
privileged groups that dominate the domestic economy, and who
therefore also largely control the government. According to this
&ldquo;Propaganda Model,&rdquo; the media serve their societal
purpose by things like the way they select topics, distribute their
concerns, frame issues, filter information, focus their analyses,
through emphasis, tone, and a whole range of other techniques like
that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, I should point
out that none of this should suggest that the media always will agree
with state policy at any given moment. Because control over the
government shifts back and forth between various elite groupings in
our society, whichever segment of the business community happens to
control the government at a particular time reflects only <i>part</i>
of an elite political spectrum, within which there are sometimes
tactical disagreements. What the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo; in
fact predicts is that this entire <i>range</i> of elite perspectives
will be reflected in the media&mdash;it&rsquo;s just there will be
essentially nothing that goes beyond it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, how do you
prove this? It&rsquo;s a big, complex topic, but let me just point
out four basic observations to start with, then we can go into more
detail if you like. The first point is that the &ldquo;Propaganda
Model&rdquo; actually has a fair amount of elite advocacy. In fact,
there&rsquo;s a very significant tradition among elite democratic
thinkers in the West which claims that the media and the intellectual
class in general <i>ought</i> to carry out a propaganda
function&mdash;they&rsquo;re supposed to marginalize the general
population by controlling what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;the public
mind.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">37</font></sup>
This view has probably been the  dominant theme in Anglo-American
democratic thought for over three hundred years, and it remains so
right until the present. You can trace the thinking on this back to
the first major popular-democratic revolution in the West, the
English Civil War in the 1640s [an armed conflict between supporters
of the King and the Parliament for sovereignty over England from 1642
to 1648].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, elites on both
sides of the Civil War in England&mdash;on the one hand the landed
gentry and rising merchant class, who were aligned with Parliament,
and on the other the Royalists, who represented more traditional
elite groupings&mdash;were very worried about all the popular ferment
that was starting to develop in the context of the elite struggle. I
mean, there were popular movements springing up which were
challenging everything&mdash;the relationship between master and
servant, the right of authority altogether; there was a lot of
radical publishing taking place because the printing press had just
been invented, and so on and so forth. And elites on both sides of
the Civil War were very worried that the general population suddenly
was beginning to get out of control. As they put it, the people are
becoming &ldquo;so curious and so arrogant that they will never find
humility enough to submit to a civil rule.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">38</font></sup>
So both the King and the Parliament were losing the capacity to
coerce, and they had to react to that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the first
thing they tried to do was to reintroduce the capacity to coerce:
there was an absolutist state for a time, and then the King was
restored [Charles II regained the throne in 1660 after several years
of rule by Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s military administration]. But they
couldn&rsquo;t change everything back, they couldn&rsquo;t regain
total control, and a lot of what the popular movements had been
fighting for slowly began to work its way into the development of
British political democracy [e.g. constitutional monarchy was
established in 1689 and a Bill of Rights adopted]. And ever since
then, every time popular movements have succeeded in dissolving power
to a certain extent, there has been a deepening recognition among
elites in the West that as you begin to lose the power to control
people by force, you have to start to control what they think. And in
the United States, that recognition has reached its apogee.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So in the twentieth
century, there&rsquo;s a major current of American thought&mdash;in
fact, it&rsquo;s probably the dominant current among people who think
about these things (political scientists, journalists, public
relations experts and so on)&mdash;which says that precisely because
the state has lost the power to coerce, elites need to have more
effective propaganda to control the public mind. That was Walter
Lippmann&rsquo;s point of view, for example, to mention probably the
dean of American journalists&mdash;he referred to the population as a
&ldquo;bewildered herd&rdquo;: we have to protect ourselves from &ldquo;the
rage and trampling of the bewildered herd.&rdquo; And the way you do
it, Lippmann said, is by what he called the &ldquo;manufacture of
consent&rdquo;&mdash;if you don&rsquo;t do it by force, you have to
do it by the calculated &ldquo;manufacture of consent.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">39</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Back in the 1920s,
the major manual of the public relations industry actually was titled
<i>Propaganda</i> (in those days, people were a little bit more
honest). It opens saying something like this: the conscious and
intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the
masses is a central feature of a democratic system&mdash;the wording
is virtually like that. Then it says: it is the job of the
&ldquo;intelligent minorities&rdquo; to carry out this manipulation
of the attitudes and opinions of the masses.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">40</font></sup>
And really that&rsquo;s the leading doctrine of modern
liberal-democratic intellectual thought: that if you lose the power
to control people by force, you need better indoctrination.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">41</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, that&rsquo;s
the first point about the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo;&mdash;it has
traditionally been supported and advocated by a substantial part of
the elite intellectual tradition. The second point I&rsquo;ve already
mentioned&mdash;it&rsquo;s that the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo;
has a kind of prior plausibility: if you look at their institutional
structure, you&rsquo;d expect that the corporate media <i>would</i>
serve a propaganda function in a business-dominated society like
ours. A third point is that the general public actually tends to
agree with the basic features of the &ldquo;Propaganda Model.&rdquo;
So contrary to what&rsquo;s usually said, if you look at poll
results, most of the public thinks that the media are too conformist
and too subservient to power&mdash;it&rsquo;s very different from the
media&rsquo;s self-image, obviously, but that&rsquo;s the public&rsquo;s
image of them.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">42</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, from just
these three initial observations&mdash;elite advocacy, prior
plausibility, and the public&rsquo;s perspective&mdash;you would at
least draw one conclusion: that the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo;
ought to be a part of the ongoing <i>debate</i> about how the media
function. You would think that would be enough grounds to make it a
part of the discussion you often hear presented about the media&rsquo;s
role, right? Well, it never is a part of that discussion: the
&ldquo;debate&rdquo; is always over whether the media are too extreme
in their undermining of authority and their criticism of power, or
whether they are simply serving their &ldquo;traditional Jeffersonian
role&rdquo; as a check on power. This other position&mdash;which says
that there <i>is</i> no &ldquo;traditional Jeffersonian role,&rdquo;
and that the media, like the intellectual community in general, are
basically subservient to power&mdash;is never part of the discussion
at all. And there&rsquo;s a very good reason why that&rsquo;s the
case, actually&mdash;because discussing the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo;
would <i>itself</i> be dysfunctional to the institutions, so
therefore it simply is excluded. The &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo;
in fact <i>predicts</i> that it won&rsquo;t be discussible in the
media.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, okay, those are
the first three observations. The fourth has to do with the empirical
validity of the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo;&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
of course the meat of the matter. Is the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo;
descriptively accurate? Is it true that the media serve the
&ldquo;traditional Jeffersonian role,&rdquo; or do they rather follow
the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo;?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, to answer that
question satisfactorily for yourself, you have to do a lot of
investigation and examine an extensive amount of material on the
question. But just to give you kind of an outline of how one can go
about it, methodologically speaking&mdash;the first way we tested the
model in <i>Manufacturing Consent</i> was to submit it to what is
really its harshest possible test: we let the opponents select their
own ground. See, if you don&rsquo;t do this, a critic can always
attack you by saying, &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re just picking examples
 that work.&rdquo; Fine, so you let the opponents select their own
ground: you take the cases that people on the other side of the
spectrum point to to show that the media go too far in their
undermining of authority, you take the examples <i>they</i> select to
prove <i>their</i> position&mdash;like the Vietnam War, or Watergate,
or other cases like that&mdash;and you look at those examples to see
whether they follow the &ldquo;Propaganda Model.&rdquo; So that was
the first thing we did: we let the opponents pick the ground, so
there would be no question of taking the wrong sample or anything
like that. And the result was, even when you let the opponents pick
the ground, you still get very strong confirmation of the &ldquo;Propaganda
Model.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another thing we&rsquo;ve
done is to document the range of permitted opinion in the media, just
to discover what the bounds of expressible thought actually are in
the mainstream. We&rsquo;ve looked at crucial historical examples in
detail. We&rsquo;ve studied media treatment of closely paired
examples&mdash;I mean, history doesn&rsquo;t construct controlled
experiments for you, but there are lots of historical events that are
more or less paired, and it&rsquo;s possible to compare how the media
deal with them. So we&rsquo;ve examined media coverage of atrocities
committed by enemy states and compared it to coverage of atrocities
which were roughly on the same scale, but for which the United States
was responsible. We&rsquo;ve compared coverage of elections in enemy
states and in client states. We&rsquo;ve looked at the treatment of
problems of freedom of the press in official enemies and in client
states. And there are a lot of other topics we&rsquo;ve investigated
as well.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">43</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So we&rsquo;ve
studied a great number of cases, from every methodological point of
view that we&rsquo;ve been able to think of&mdash;and they all
support the &ldquo;Propaganda Model.&rdquo; And by now there are
thousands of pages of similar material confirming the thesis in books
and articles by other people too&mdash;in fact, I would hazard a
guess that the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo; is one of the
best-confirmed theses in the social sciences. There has been no
serious counter-discussion of it at all, actually, that I&rsquo;m
aware of.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">44</font></sup>
But that&rsquo;s all irrelevant within the mainstream culture&mdash;and
the point is, it will all <i>stay</i> irrelevant, even if the level
of proof were to reach way beyond what could ever be achieved in the
social sciences. In fact, even if you could prove it at the level of
physics, it would always remain irrelevant within the mainstream
institutions. And the reason for that is that the &ldquo;Propaganda
Model&rdquo; is in fact valid, and it predicts that it will be
irrelevant&mdash;and in fact, not even be <i>understandable</i>
within the elite culture&mdash;no matter how well it&rsquo;s proven.
And that&rsquo;s because what it reveals undermines very effective
and useful ideological institutions, so it&rsquo;s dysfunctional to
them, and will be excluded.</p>

</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But Mr.
Chomsky, don&rsquo;t you think you might be making a bit of an
intellectually lazy assumption as you draw up this analysis&mdash;namely,
that there&rsquo;s this monolith &ldquo;the media&rdquo;? Isn&rsquo;t
it a bit hypocritical to expect the media to be any different from
the rest of the American population in the views it advocates?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the media <i>are</i>
different from the general population&mdash;they&rsquo;re very much
like American elites.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I&rsquo;m
not necessarily sure that&rsquo;s true, I&rsquo;m not sure how you
could prove it one way or the other.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think you <i>can</i>
prove it, actually: on major issues there is a very noticeable split
between elite and popular opinion, and the media consistently reflect
<i>elite</i> opinion. So for example, on things like, say,
dismantling welfare state programs, or on a nuclear weapons freeze,
or on U.S. policies in Central America in the 1980s, or on the nature
of the Vietnam War, the views expressed in the media have always been
very different from public opinion, and in line with elite opinion.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">45</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: My point is
that it&rsquo;s not necessarily a transformation of the media, but a
transformation of society that you&rsquo;re looking towards. It can
be a lazy diversion just to talk about the media as &ldquo;them.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I think you
<i>would</i> need a transformation of society to change the media&mdash;but
I still think it&rsquo;s right to call the media &ldquo;them.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Take a look

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>OTHERS: No, no.</i></p>

wrong.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There I really
disagree. I mean, I think it&rsquo;s a good question to examine, but
I don&rsquo;t agree. After all, what <i>are</i> the media? Who are
they? Are they &ldquo;us&rdquo;? Take C.B.S., or the <i>New York
Times</i>&mdash;who are they? They&rsquo;re among the major
corporations in the country, they&rsquo;re not &ldquo;us.&rdquo; They
are no more &ldquo;us&rdquo; than General Motors is &ldquo;us.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The question is: are
the media like a sample of public opinion? Is it that the public has
a certain range of beliefs and the media are just a sample of it? If
that were the case, the media would be very democratic in fact.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: The only
poll that I&rsquo;ve seen about journalists is that they are
basically narcissistic and left of center.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, what people
call &ldquo;left of center&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean anything&mdash;it
means they&rsquo;re conventional liberals, and conventional liberals
are very state-oriented, and usually dedicated to private power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But if there
is only a small percentage of the American population that is
actively dissident, I think it&rsquo;s unfair to expect any greater
percentage than that in the media.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, you have to
look closely: I think there&rsquo;s plenty of evidence that public
opinion and media presentation have differed quite sharply. The
general public regarded the media as much too easy on the Reagan
administration, they thought there should have been <i>more</i>
exposure. In fact, they thought that the media were too hard on
Carter, but too easy on Reagan&mdash;it&rsquo;s exactly the opposite
of what everybody says.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Where do
you get all this information?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">From polls.
Actually, that point is made in a pretty interesting book by Mark
Hertsgaard, called <i>On Bended Knee,</i> which is about media
coverage of the Reagan administration.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">46</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You gave the
example of the public being more in favor of welfare state programs
than the media&mdash;but in Massachusetts right now, there&rsquo;s
strong support in the general population for dismantling a lot of
social services, and for no new taxes. Don&rsquo;t you agree the
support&rsquo;s pretty strong for that these days?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No. If you ask
people, &ldquo;Do you want new taxes?&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll say no;
but if you ask them, &ldquo;Do you want better medical services?&rdquo;
they&rsquo;ll say yes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But there
has been no strong popular response against a very austere state
budget here which eliminates a lot of social services.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But is there anybody
pushing for developing <i>meaningful</i> social services? See,
suppose there was somebody with a platform saying, &ldquo;We want
everybody in Massachusetts to have access to adequate medical
care&rdquo;&mdash;I&rsquo;ll bet you if somebody was pushing <i>that,</i>
they&rsquo;d get overwhelming support. But if you just come to people
and say, &ldquo;Do you want to have new taxes?&rdquo; of course
they&rsquo;ll say no. If you have something on the ballot saying,
&ldquo;Should we put a limit on property taxes?&rdquo; the answer
will be, &ldquo;Sure, why should I pay more?&rdquo; But you&rsquo;re
not asking the right question. If you ask people, &ldquo;Do you want
your roads clean? Do you want good schools? Do you want medical
services?&rdquo; then they&rsquo;ll say yes. So part of the reason
there isn&rsquo;t much response is that there&rsquo;s no one offering
real alternatives.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it&rsquo;s also
true that there are a lot of people who just look at the world and
say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t confuse me with the facts, it&rsquo;s too
painful,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to know about reality,
it&rsquo;s too ugly.&rdquo; But they&rsquo;re not even reading the
news anymore&mdash;they only read the &ldquo;Style&rdquo; section,
and the &ldquo;Sports&rdquo; and so on. However, if you take the
people who still pay attention  to the world, it&rsquo;s pretty
striking: the population tends to regard the media as too conformist,
too subservient to power. It&rsquo;s exactly the opposite of what
everybody says. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">47</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So just take a look
at something like the nuclear freeze movement. The nuclear freeze had
virtually no support in the media, no support among politicians, and
certainly no support by business&mdash;but nevertheless, 75 percent
of the American population supported it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">48</font></sup>
Well, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> certainly not reflected in editorial
opinion or in opinion pieces in the media. Or take what&rsquo;s
certainly the most discussed media issue of the 1980s, Nicaragua.
I&rsquo;ve done a lot of analysis of opinion pieces in the national
media, like the <i>Washington Post</i> and the <i>New York Times,</i>
and it&rsquo;s uniform&mdash;well over 99 percent of them are
anti-Sandinista, and think the Sandinista Party government has to be
eliminated; the only issue is how you do it: do you do it by
attacking them with contra forces, or by some other means? Well, that
does <i>not</i> reflect public opinion. I mean, most of the public
thought we should just get out of Nicaragua and leave them alone&mdash;they
didn&rsquo;t even know which side we were on, but thought we had no
business there, so let&rsquo;s get away. That certainly wasn&rsquo;t
reflected. Then among the minority of the population who in fact knew
which side we were on, there was strong opposition to any method of
overthrowing the government.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">49</font></sup>
But that position is inexpressible in the media.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Let me just give you
an illustration. Six months in early 1986 and six months in early
1987 happened to have been the periods of greatest debate over
Nicaragua, right before the big contra aid bills came to Congress.
The <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Washington Post</i> in those two
periods published only two columns that even raised the <i>possibility</i>
that the Sandinistas should be permitted to survive. One was by the
Nicaraguan Ambassador. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">50</font></sup>
The other was by a guy named Kevin Cahill, a doctor at Lenox Hill
Hospital in New York, who&rsquo;s a specialist in tropical diseases
and who&rsquo;s worked extensively through the area. He had a column
in which he said, there&rsquo;s only one country in Latin America
where the government cares about the population, it&rsquo;s
Nicaragua: here&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re doing, we should let them
do it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">51</font></sup> That
was the one exception of an opinion column even <i>considering</i>
this position in practically a year of intensive coverage of the
issue in the two most important newspapers in the country. Now, that
certainly does not reflect popular opinion&mdash;in fact, it doesn&rsquo;t
even reflect opinion in the academic profession in this case: the
media do not accept contributions from Latin America scholars on this
issue, just because they disagree. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">52</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: There were
people who lost their jobs in the media for reporting other points of

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Oh, that happens all
the time. Ray Bonner is the famous case&mdash;he was a freelancer the
<i>New York Times</i> picked up who made the mistake of actually
reporting what was going on for about a year in El Salvador. He was
bounced off to work in the &ldquo;Metro&rdquo; section or something,
and then he just dropped out.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">53</font></sup>
And there are lots of other reporters who have just ended up leaving:
Sy Hersh, for example, left the <i>New York Times</i> because they
wouldn&rsquo;t let him do the kinds of stories he wanted to do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, I have a good
friend who&rsquo;s one of the seven or eight main editors of a major
American newspaper, and he happens to be very much opposed to U.S.
policies towards Central America, and towards the arms race, as well
as several other things. He tries to craft editorials which will just
barely sneak through under the ideological barrier, but will sort of
hint at some of the things he would like people to see&mdash;he has
to make a very careful calculation as to what will make it in.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No&mdash;that
ideological barrier reflects <i>elite</i> opinion, it&rsquo;s not
that the <i>public</i> is going to object. The public&rsquo;s not
going to mind if the editor comes out with these things; in fact,
this guy happens to be in a liberal city, the public will
applaud&mdash;it&rsquo;s in Boston.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This actually
<i>happened,</i> it&rsquo;s happened a few times. Most of the time it
never happens, because the newspapers never deviate. But in 1976 or
&rsquo;77, <i>New York Times</i> advertising and stock values began
to drop very slightly. There were immediately articles about this in
the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> and <i>Business Week,</i> pointing out
what was going on&mdash;<i>Business Week</i> in fact said, if the <i>New
York Times</i> doesn&rsquo;t realize that it&rsquo;s a business, it&rsquo;s
not going to be in business any longer.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">54</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, what was
happening was that the <i>Times</i> had taken a mildly supportive
editorial position on a New York tax bill that business was opposed
to, and advertising started slipping off a little, stocks started
dropping very slightly. And the <i>Times</i> then shifted its entire
editorial staff: John Oakes went out, all the liberal editors went
out, and a whole bunch of new people came in. All it took was a
slight change on the stock market. Now, in that case it was a matter
of such a slight deviation that you&rsquo;d need a microscope to see
it&mdash;suppose they took a major deviation, what would happen to
their stock?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In countries that
have a wider range of democratic politics than we do, where there

they don&rsquo;t care so much in a small-town paper.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, yes,
advertisers. See, the press does not make money on people buying
newspapers, they lose money on people buying newspapers.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">55</font></sup>
But the press <i>is</i> business interests&mdash;I mean, the major
press is huge corporate interests, the small press is more local
business interests, but either way it&rsquo;s kept alive by other
businesses, through advertising.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And business takes
both points of view, business is on both sides&mdash;like, in this
region, maintaining tourism is a huge thing for business, and that
means maintaining the environment. And you know, the rich folk who
move out here from New York also want to maintain the environment. So
you&rsquo;ve got very powerful, privileged interests on &ldquo;the
other side&rdquo; of this issue. See, you happened to have picked an
issue where the business community is split, and therefore the press
will present &ldquo;both sides.&rdquo; But try to start doing
something that undermines <i>all</i> business interests as such&mdash;you
will quickly find that you&rsquo;re not a journalist anymore. I mean,
they may be willing to keep you on as a maverick just for the fun of
it, but if you ever get to the point where you&rsquo;re influencing
people&rsquo;s attitudes about public policy or power, you&rsquo;re
not going to stay on. And that&rsquo;s exactly why people who say

&ldquo;opinions on both sides.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s an opinion on both
sides.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, one of the
things that Edward Herman and I did in <i>Manufacturing Consent</i>
was to just look at the sources that reporters go to. In a part that
I wrote, I happened to be discussing Central America, so I went
through fifty articles by Stephen Kinzer of the <i>New York Times</i>
beginning in October 1987, and just asked: whose opinions did he try
to get? Well, it turns out that in fifty articles he did not talk to
one person in Nicaragua who was pro-Sandinista. Now, there&rsquo;s
got to be <i>somebody</i>&mdash;you know, Ortega&rsquo;s mother,
<i>somebody&rsquo;s</i> got to be pro-Sandinista. Nope, in fact,
everybody he quotes is anti-Sandinista. [Daniel Ortega was the
Sandinista President.]</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there are
polls, which the <i>Times</i> won&rsquo;t report, and they show that
all of the opposition parties in Nicaragua combined had the support
of only 9 percent of the population. But they have 100 percent of
Stephen Kinzer&mdash;everyone he&rsquo;s found supports the
opposition parties, 9 percent of the population. That&rsquo;s in
fifty articles.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">56</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I think your
indictment of subtlety is again simplistic. For instance, I read an
article you wrote for The Progressive about reporters&rsquo;
dependence on government sources&mdash;that&rsquo;s really important,
you have to get economic figures, you have to develop long-term
sources, you can&rsquo;t get the information otherwise. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">57</font></sup>
Why do you have such a low opinion of the readership to think that
they&rsquo;re not going to pick up on the subtlety? It may be in the
fifth or sixth paragraph, but you can see the reporter&rsquo;s own
opinion there.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I don&rsquo;t
understand what you&rsquo;re saying. What I&rsquo;m saying is that if
you look at the sources reporters select, they are not sources that
are expert, they are sources that represent vested interests: that&rsquo;s
propaganda.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: But I
don&rsquo;t think the journalists say that to themselves&mdash;they
want to think they&rsquo;re doing an honest job.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sure they do, but
you can see exactly how it works. Suppose that as a reporter you
start going outside of vested interests. You will find, first of all,
that the level of evidence that&rsquo;s required is far higher. You
don&rsquo;t need verification when you go to vested interests,
they&rsquo;re self-verifying. Like, if you report an atrocity carried
out by guerrillas, all you need is one hearsay witness. You talk
about torture carried out by an American military officer, you&rsquo;re
going to need videotapes. And the same is true on every issue.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, if a
journalist quotes an unnamed &ldquo;high U.S. government official,&rdquo;
that suffices as evidence. What if they were to quote some dissident,
or some official from a foreign government that&rsquo;s an enemy?
Well, they&rsquo;d have to start digging, and backing it up, and the
reporter would have to have mountains of evidence, and expect to pick
up a ton of flack, and maybe lose their job, and so on. With factors
of that kind, it&rsquo;s very predictable which way they&rsquo;re
going to go. And reporters generally pick the easy way; I mean, the
laziness is phenomenal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Would you
characterize this media analysis as a &ldquo;conspiracy theory&rdquo;
at all?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s precisely
the opposite of conspiracy theory, actually&mdash;in fact, in general
this analysis tends to downplay the role of individuals: they&rsquo;re
just replaceable pieces.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, part of the
structure of corporate capitalism is that the players in the game try
to increase profits and market shares&mdash;if they don&rsquo;t do
that, they will no longer be players in the game. Any economist knows
this: it&rsquo;s not a conspiracy theory to point that out, it&rsquo;s
just taken for granted as an institutional fact. If someone were to
say, &ldquo;Oh no, that&rsquo;s a conspiracy theory,&rdquo; people
would laugh. Well, what we&rsquo;ve been discussing are simply the
institutional factors that set the boundaries for reporting and
interpretation in the ideological institutions. That&rsquo;s the
opposite of conspiracy theory, it&rsquo;s just normal institutional
analysis, the kind of analysis you do automatically when you&rsquo;re
trying to understand how the world works. For people to call it
&ldquo;conspiracy theory&rdquo; is part of the effort to prevent an
understanding of how the world works, in my view&mdash;&ldquo;conspiracy
theory&rdquo; has become the intellectual equivalent of a four-letter
word: it&rsquo;s something people say when they don&rsquo;t want you
to think about what&rsquo;s really going on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What role
would you say the alternative media play in the &ldquo;Propaganda
Model&rdquo;?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it varies. I
think to some extent the alternative media play a role <i>within</i>
the &ldquo;Propaganda Model.&rdquo; So a lot of what&rsquo;s called
the &ldquo;alternative media&rdquo; in the United States is really
just a kind of commercialization of freakishness&mdash;like 95
percent of the <i>Village Voice,</i> for example, or maybe 99
percent. I regard that as just another technique of marginalization
of the public: it&rsquo;s sort of another version of the <i>National
Enquirer,</i> just for a different audience.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, to a
significant extent the alternative media play a very constructive
role&mdash;often they present people with an alternative view of the
world, and that does make a difference. For example, I travel around
giving talks all over the country, and I&rsquo;ve noticed that in
places that have listener-supported radio, there&rsquo;s just a
different feel in the community&mdash;there&rsquo;s a place that
people can go to, and relate themselves to, and find out what&rsquo;s
 going on, and hear other people, and contribute, and construct a
different conception of the world and how it works on a continuing
basis. I mean, you feel it right away if something like that is going
on, and you feel it if nothing&rsquo;s going on. The alternative
political journals are the same.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But notice that
anything that&rsquo;s alternative is going to be lacking in resources
and lacking in outreach&mdash;it&rsquo;s like alternatives to
automobile production: you can do it, but it&rsquo;s going to be
extremely difficult. So I don&rsquo;t know the details, but I imagine
that if you compare the resources behind, say, F.A.I.R. [Fairness and
Accuracy In Reporting, a left-wing media-monitoring group] and A.I.M.
[Accuracy In Media, a right-wing one], you&rsquo;ll come out with a
very good estimate of what&rsquo;s involved.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">58</font></sup>
And it&rsquo;s only natural that powerful interests wouldn&rsquo;t
want to support genuinely alternative structures&mdash;why would an
institution function in such a way as to undermine itself? Of course
that&rsquo;s not going to happen.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Recently
on public television there was a series of programs about clandestine
activities and the atomic bomb which brought out a lot of information
that seemed to go against those powerful interests, though&mdash;it
was very unusual, the kind of thing you almost never see. I&rsquo;m
wondering what you think its purpose might have been.</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.15in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 0.28in">
<i>I was extremely surprised at the openness of what was being said:
they mentioned Operation MONGOOSE, the assassination attempts on
Castro, connections between the Kennedys and the Mafia; they talked
about the U.S. recruiting some of the worst Nazis to work for us at
the end of World War II.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">59</font></sup>
I&rsquo;m curious why those kinds of things are coming out now: why
is it happening at this point, and in such a public forum? You were
talking before about things sometimes slipping through the
cracks&mdash;this is more than slipping through the cracks.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, is it really?
How many people saw it? See, and these are pretty activist people,
people who are attuned to that sort of thing. And it&rsquo;s not the
first time that this has happened&mdash;a lot of this material
already appeared in the media, in 1975. So it would be interesting to
know exactly why it is coming out now, but some things come to mind
right off.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first set of
exposures was in 1975, which was right after Watergate; the second
set of exposures is right now, which happens to be right after
Iran-contra. And it&rsquo;s very typical that after government
scandals like these, there&rsquo;s a period of relative openness in
the media, which then closes up again. In fact, there are plenty of
journalists who are very well aware of this fact, and who wait for
government scandals to try to sneak through stories which they know
they couldn&rsquo;t get published at other times. I can give you
examples of that, if you&rsquo;d like. And it&rsquo;s obvious why
it&rsquo;s going to happen: there&rsquo;s a scandal, so the
institutions want to legitimize themselves, and there&rsquo;s popular
pressure, so journalists who want to write about things like this
have a little bit of an opening to do it. That may be the reason.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Incidentally, there
are going to be some more exposures in the media in a  week or two on
the show <i>Frontline</i>&mdash;which if P.B.S. runs it (they&rsquo;re
now debating it), will be very interesting. It&rsquo;s an episode on
the Middle East by Leslie and Andrew Cockburn, and from what I&rsquo;ve
heard, it&rsquo;s extremely well done. So it&rsquo;s not that these
systems are <i>completely</i> closed to dissidents&mdash;even on
commercial television, there are possibilities. For instance, when
Leslie Cockburn was working at C.B.S., she was able to expose
information of real importance about U.S. government involvement in
drug-running through the contras. I don&rsquo;t know if some of you
saw that, but this was on a national network program, <i>West
57th</i>&mdash;tens of millions of people were watching American
pilots in jail testifying about how they would fly arms down to the
contras and come back with their planes loaded with cocaine, land at
Homestead Air Force base in Florida guided in by radar, then trucks
would come up and unload the drugs and take them away, all right on
the Air Force base. That was on C.B.S.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">60</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So there <i>are</i>
openings for investigative reporting, and there are people in the
media who look for them and find them. In fact, some of the top
investigative reporters in the country are very conscious of the way
the system works and play it like a violin, just looking for moments
when they can sneak stories through. Some of the best-known of them
are even more cynical about the media than I am, actually&mdash;but
they just find ways to work within the system, and often they get out
material that&rsquo;s very important. So people will store up stories
on topics they&rsquo;ve researched, and wait for a time when it&rsquo;s
going to be a little bit more lax and they can put them in. Or
they&rsquo;ll look for the right editor, they write their points very
carefully and frame them so they&rsquo;ll just get by.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember, there
really are conflicting values in these systems, and those conflicts
allow for possibilities. One value is service to power; another value
is professional integrity&mdash;and journalists can&rsquo;t do their
job of serving power effectively unless they know how to work with
some integrity, but if they know how to work with some integrity,
they&rsquo;re also going to want to exercise that value in other
areas. It&rsquo;s extremely hard to control that conflict, and things
certainly do get through sometimes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Plus, you know,
there also just is a need in the media to present a tolerably
accurate picture of the world&mdash;and that also creates openings.
So for example, take the <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> the prototypical
business press: the editorial pages are just comical tantrums, but
the news coverage is often quite interesting and well done, they have
some of the best reporting in the country, in fact. And I think the
reason for that is pretty clear. On the editorial page of the <i>Wall
Street Journal,</i> the editors can scream and yell and foam at the
mouth and nobody cares very much, but people in the business world
have to have a realistic picture of what&rsquo;s happening in the
world if they&rsquo;re going to make sane decisions about their
money. Well, that also creates openings, and those openings can often
be capitalized on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the main point is
not total suppression of information by the media&mdash;that&rsquo;s
rare, although it certainly exists. The main point is the shaping of
history,  the selection, the interpretation that takes place. I mean,
just to give one illustration, I doubt that any story ever received
the kind of fanatical level of coverage as the downing of Korean Air
Lines Flight 007 by the Russians in 1983&mdash;that was presented as
sure proof that the Russians were the worst barbarians since Attila
the Hun, and that we therefore had to install missiles in Germany,
and step up the war against Nicaragua, and so on. Well, for the month
of September 1983 alone, the <i>New York Times</i> index&mdash;you
know, the very densely printed index of articles that have appeared
in the <i>Times</i>&mdash;has seven full pages devoted to this story.
That&rsquo;s the <i>index,</i> for one month alone. The liberal
<i>Boston Globe</i> on the first day of coverage had I think its
first ten full pages devoted to that story and nothing else. I mean,
I didn&rsquo;t check, but I doubt that even the outbreak of the
Second World War had that much coverage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, there were
other events that took place in the midst of all of the furor over
the K.A.L. flight&mdash;for example, the <i>Times</i> devoted one
hundred words and no comment to the following fact: U.N.I.T.A., who
are the so-called &ldquo;freedom fighters&rdquo; supported by the
United States and South Africa in Angola, <i>took credit</i> for
downing an Angolan civilian jet plane with 126 people killed. Now,
there were no ambiguities in this case: the plane wasn&rsquo;t off
course, there was no R.C.-135 confusing the issue [K.A.L. Flight 007
had flown off course into Soviet airspace, and a U.S. Air Force
R.C.-135 spy plane had been patrolling the same area earlier that
day]. This was just premeditated mass murder&mdash;and that deserved
a hundred words and no further comment.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">61</font></sup>
A few years earlier, in October 1976, a Cuban airliner was bombed by
C.I.A.-backed terrorists, killing 73 civilians. How much coverage was
there of that?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">62</font></sup>
In 1973, Israel downed a civilian plane lost in a sandstorm over the
Suez Canal with 110 people killed. There was no protest, only
editorial comments about&mdash;I&rsquo;m quoting from the <i>Times</i>&mdash;how
&ldquo;no useful purpose is served by an acrimonious debate over the
assignment of blame.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">63</font></sup>
Four days later, Golda Meir [the Israeli Prime Minister] arrived in
the United States, and the press troubled her with few embarrassing
questions&mdash;in fact, she returned home with new gifts of military
aircraft.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">64</font></sup>
Going back to 1955, an Air India plane carrying the Chinese
delegation to the Bandung Conference was blown up in the air in what
the Hong Kong police called &ldquo;a carefully planned mass murder&rdquo;;
an American defector later claimed that he had planted the bomb in
the service of the C.I.A.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">65</font></sup>
In July 1988, the U.S. warship <i>Vincennes</i> shot down an Iranian
civilian airliner in a commercial air corridor off the coast of Iran
with 290 people killed&mdash;out of a need to prove the viability of
its high-tech missile system, according to U.S. Navy Commander David
Carlson, who was monitoring the event from a nearby ship and said
that he &ldquo;wondered aloud in disbelief.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">66</font></sup>
None of these incidents was held to demonstrate &ldquo;barbarism,&rdquo;
and in fact all have been quickly forgotten.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, one could
offer thousands of such examples, and a lot of people, including me,
have done so in print. These are the ways in which history is  shaped
in the interests of those in power&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the kind of
thing I&rsquo;m saying about the press. The information sometimes is
<i>reported,</i> but the media isn&rsquo;t <i>presenting</i> it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">67</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8536_2032848809"></a>Honest
Subordination<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I&rsquo;m
wondering how people inside the media tend to respond to this type of
institutional critique.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, to draw a
broad brush-stroke through it, by and large the media love to be
attacked from the right&mdash;they love it when they&rsquo;re
attacked as being subversive, adversarial, going so far in their
passion to undermine power that they&rsquo;re destroying democracy,
and so on. They even love being told that they&rsquo;re <i>lying</i>
in their commitment to undermine power&mdash;there are dramatic
examples of this. And it&rsquo;s obvious why they like it so much:
then they can come back and say, as Katharine Graham [owner of the
<i>Washington Post</i>] did in a commencement address, well yes, it&rsquo;s
true that in our antiestablishment zeal we sometimes go too far, but
that&rsquo;s the price you have to pay in a free society. It makes
great copy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
if they&rsquo;re criticized from the opposite side, saying: &ldquo;Look,
you may do your work with a good deal of integrity, but you&rsquo;re
very subordinated to power&mdash;indeed servile, often&mdash;in the
way that you select topics, and shape them, and adopt perspectives,&rdquo;
<i>that</i> they hate. So they don&rsquo;t like to be told that
they&rsquo;re doing their work honestly but subordinated to
power&mdash;they much prefer to be told, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
dishonest in your efforts to undermine power.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To give you a recent
example, one of the major right-wing attacks on the media was a huge
two-volume study published by an organization called &ldquo;Freedom
House&rdquo; (nice Orwellian name) which criticized media coverage of
the Tet Offensive in the Vietnam War, reaching the conclusion that
the media basically lost the war for us by their lack of
patriotism.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">68</font></sup>
The thrust of the study was that the media had lied about the Tet
Offensive and had presented a North Vietnamese/Viet Cong defeat as a
great victory for the enemy, and had thereby undermined the American
war effort. That was the fundamental claim, and to support it they
alleged that the media had distorted what people had said, and had
falsified the evidence, and so on and so forth. The media loved it,
they just lapped it up&mdash;and ever since then, that&rsquo;s been
the standard story.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">69</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the fact of
the matter is that this Freedom House study was immediately exposed
as a hoax, in a journalism review which was widely read. I wrote the
article .<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">70</font></sup>
The study was almost a total fraud: when you corrected the hundreds
of crucial errors and falsifications, what you were left with was the
conclusion that American journalists had covered the Tet Offensive
quite honestly, in a very narrow sense&mdash;that is, they had
described  accurately what was in front of their eyes&mdash;but they
had done it within a framework of patriotic premises which distorted
the whole picture quite considerably.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for example,
reporters would describe how the U.S. forces were wiping out towns in
South Vietnam, and they&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;This is an unfortunate
necessity, but we have to defend these towns from attackers.&rdquo;
Well, there were no attackers except the Americans&mdash;there were
no Russians, no Chinese, virtually no North Vietnamese, nobody but
the American aggressors.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">71</font></sup>
But of course, nobody in the press could say <i>that.</i> So,
narrowly speaking, the media did an honest job, though always from a
perspective very much shaped by U.S. government propaganda. And as to
their depicting an enemy defeat as a victory, that&rsquo;s just
totally false: the press was much more optimistic about the outcome
of the Tet Offensive than official U.S. intelligence was&mdash;and we
know that, because the intelligence reports appear in the <i>Pentagon
Papers</i> [top-secret Defense Department planning record of U.S.
involvement in Southeast Asia, leaked to the public in 1971 ].<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">72</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So in reality, what
it comes down to is that Freedom House was accusing the media of not
being sufficiently <i>upbeat and enthusiastic</i> in their adoption
of the government propaganda framework. Well, that&rsquo;s pure
totalitarianism. But the critique of their study disappeared, nobody
pays the slightest attention to it. It&rsquo;s been reprinted a
number of times and amplified, it&rsquo;s all thoroughly documented
and supported, but nobody wants to hear it. The media do not want to
hear that they did an honest job, but within the framework of state
power; they&rsquo;d much rather hear that they were so subversive
they may have even undermined democracy.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8538_2032848809"></a>&ldquo;Fight
it Better&rdquo;: the Media and the Vietnam War<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: I had the
impression that during the anti-Vietnam War period there was more
openness in the media to the progressive movements than there is now,
for instance in the New York Times and the Washington Post.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s an
illusion people have&mdash;actually, there was less openness. Look, I
can tell you about that, because I was right in the middle of it, and
also I&rsquo;ve studied it in great detail . . .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: From
reading today&rsquo;s newspapers, I think there&rsquo;s been a
definite shift to the right.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, I don&rsquo;t
agree with that. People do have that illusion, but I think it&rsquo;s
because their perspective has shifted to the <i>left</i>&mdash;and
that runs across most of the population, actually. So for example,
the stance that most movement activists considered an anti-war
position in 1969, they would today consider to be a <i>pro-war</i>
position&mdash;accurately. I mean, in 1969 it was  considered
anti-war to say we&rsquo;re not fighting well enough: that was called
&ldquo;anti-war.&rdquo; So I don&rsquo;t know <i>you</i> of course,
but if you&rsquo;re like the ordinary movement activist, I would
guess that your perspective also has shifted in the last twenty
years, and that&rsquo;s where this impression is coming from.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As for the <i>New
York Times,</i> another of the things Ed Herman and I did in
<i>Manufacturing Consent</i> was to spend about 150 pages reviewing
mostly the <i>New York Times</i> on the Vietnam War from 1950 to the
present&mdash;and the fact is, the <i>Times</i> was always to the
hawkish side of the population, very far. They were never critical of
it. There was never a critical columnist. They consciously suppressed
U.S. government actions. When you look back at the reporters we
thought of as critical, David Halberstam and others, Neil Sheehan,
you&rsquo;ll discover that what they were criticizing was the
<i>failure</i>&mdash;they were saying, &ldquo;Of course it&rsquo;s a
noble cause and we want to win, but you guys are screwing it up.
Fight it better.&rdquo; It was that kind of criticism.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">73</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This comes out very
clearly in Sheehan&rsquo;s new book actually, this best-seller that
just won the Pulitzer Prize, <i>A Bright Shining Lie.</i> <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">74</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s being highly touted everywhere as a big expos&eacute; of
the Vietnam War, but if you look at it closely, what it&rsquo;s
really exposing is the fact that the things American intelligence
experts were saying in the field were not getting communicated back
to Washington&mdash;that&rsquo;s the nature of Sheehan&rsquo;s
criticism. And that&rsquo;s still considered the far-out anti-war
position in the mainstream, even today: &ldquo;You guys screwed it
up, you should have fought it better.&rdquo; Sheehan&rsquo;s book is
sort of a biography of John Paul Vann, who was an extreme hawk [he
oversaw &ldquo;civilian pacification&rdquo; programs in Vietnam], but
perceptive&mdash;he understood what was going on, and was on the
scene in the field giving young reporters information that said
things weren&rsquo;t going the way Washington said they were going
(which was considered totally unpatriotic: how can you say it&rsquo;s
not going the way Washington says?). And he&rsquo;s Sheehan&rsquo;s
hero of the whole war.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, just take a
look at Vann. He leaked some memoranda in 1965 which were used in the
peace movement&mdash;like, I published them, and Ed Herman published
them and so on, but the mainstream media would never publish them,
and in fact Sheehan doesn&rsquo;t even mention them in his book.
Basically they said something like this: in South Vietnam, the
National Liberation Front&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;Viet Cong&rdquo;&mdash;has
won the population over to their side, and they&rsquo;ve won the
population over to their side because they have good political
programs. The peasants support them because they&rsquo;re the right
people to support, we ought to be supporting their programs too.
There&rsquo;s a social revolution in progress in South Vietnam, it&rsquo;s
a badly needed social revolution, the N.L.F. is organizing it, and
that&rsquo;s why they have peasant support; there&rsquo;s nothing we
can do about that. Well, then comes the conclusion. The conclusion
is, we&rsquo;ve got to escalate the war, we have to wipe the N.L.F.
out.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">75</font></sup> And
the reason is essentially the same as what&rsquo;s argued by people
like Walter Lippmann and the whole rest of this main tradition of
&ldquo;democratic&rdquo; thinkers in the West&mdash;that democracy
requires a class  of elites to manage decision-making and
&ldquo;manufacture&rdquo; the general population&rsquo;s consent for
policies that are supposedly beyond their capacity to develop and
decide on themselves. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">76</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for Vann, the
thinking was, these stupid Vietnamese peasants are making a
mistake&mdash;it&rsquo;s us smart guys who are the ones who can run
the social revolution for them. They think the N.L.F. can run it,
these people running around villages organizing them, but <i>we&rsquo;re</i>
really the only ones who can run it. And out of our duty to the poor
people of the world, we can&rsquo;t let them have their own way,
because it&rsquo;ll just be a stupid error on their part. So what we
have to do is wipe out the N.L.F., win the war, smash up Vietnam, and
then we&rsquo;ll run the social revolution for them&mdash;like we&rsquo;ve
always done in history, you know. That&rsquo;s basically Vann&rsquo;s
line, and that&rsquo;s also the message of Neil Sheehan&rsquo;s book.
That&rsquo;s what made Vann a hero.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or just take a look
at the guy who was certainly the most critical columnist at the
<i>Times,</i> Anthony Lewis. I mean, if you look at Anthony Lewis&rsquo;s
<i>record</i> during the war, you&rsquo;ll really learn something
about the peace movement, about ourselves&mdash;because we actually
regarded Anthony Lewis as an <i>ally.</i> Let&rsquo;s remember what
happened. The hard work in the peace movement was from 1964 through
&rsquo;67. By February 1968, corporate America had turned against the
war&mdash;and the reason was, the Tet Offensive had taken place in
late January. In late January 1968, there was this huge popular
uprising in every city in South Vietnam; it was all South Vietnamese,
remember, it wasn&rsquo;t the North Vietnamese who were doing it. And
by early February 1968, it was obvious to anybody with their head
screwed on that this was just a massive popular movement. I mean, the
American forces in Saigon were never even <i>informed</i> that Viet
Cong troops were infiltrating into the city&mdash;nobody told them.
And it was simultaneous, and coordinated, it was just a huge popular
uprising&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing like it in history.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you know,
people who care about their money and their property and so on
realized that this war was just money going down the drain&mdash;it
was going to take a huge effort to crush this revolution. And by that
point, the U.S. economy was actually beginning to suffer. That&rsquo;s
the great achievement of the peace movement, in fact: it harmed the
American economy. And that&rsquo;s not a joke. The peace movement
made it impossible to declare a national mobilization around the
war&mdash;there was just too much dissidence and disruption, they
couldn&rsquo;t do what was done during the Second World War, for
example, when the whole population was mobilized around the war. See,
if they could have gotten the population mobilized like that, then
the Vietnam War would have been very good for the economy, like the
Second World War was during the Forties, a real shot in the arm. But
they couldn&rsquo;t, they had to fight a deficit-spending war, what&rsquo;s
called a &ldquo;gunsand-butter&rdquo; war. And the result was that we
got the beginnings of stagflation [inflation without a concurrent
expansion of the economy], and weakening of the U.S. dollar, and our
main economic competitors, Europe and Japan, began raking off huge
profits as offshore producers for the  war&mdash;in short, the war
changed the economic balance of power between the U.S. and its major
industrial rivals. Well, American business could understand that,
they saw what was happening, and when the Tet Offensive came along
and it was clear that there was going to be a big problem putting
down this revolution, corporate America turned against the war.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, they were
worried about what was happening at home at the time&mdash;very
worried. See, here we have exposed secret documents, which are
extremely enlightening. If you look at the very tail end of the
<i>Pentagon Papers</i>, for example, the part that deals with the
weeks after the Tet Offensive, the top American military brass said
that they were concerned about sending more troops to Vietnam,
because they were afraid they wouldn&rsquo;t have enough troops left
over for what they called &ldquo;civil disorder control&rdquo; at
home&mdash;they were afraid of a revolution breaking out if they
continued escalating the war. And they referred to the problems:
youth, women, ethnic minorities, all these groups were starting to
get involved in protest.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">77</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And actually, there
was also another factor here that I should mention: the American army
was falling apart. Remember, this was a citizens&rsquo; army, and it
was the first time in history that a citizens&rsquo; army was being
used to fight a colonial war&mdash;and that doesn&rsquo;t work. I
mean, you cannot take kids off the street and turn them into
professional killers in a couple months&mdash;for that you need Nazis
like the French Foreign Legion [an army of foreigners used to fight
in France&rsquo;s colonies], or peasants that you mobilize and give
guns to and turn into cold-blooded killers, like the contras, say.
That&rsquo;s the way every imperial power in history has run its
empire. But the United States tried to do it with a citizens&rsquo;
army, and by 1968 it was already collapsing: drugs, lack of
discipline, shooting your officers. And all of that was also a
reflection of the popular movement at home: this is a youth culture,
after all, and the guys who were going into the army were not all
that different from the ones at home who were getting involved in the
various movements. So the American army was falling apart, and the
top Pentagon brass didn&rsquo;t like it: they in fact wanted the army
out.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">78</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, let&rsquo;s
go back to the <i>New York Times.</i> All this time the <i>New York
Times</i> had no criticism of the war: nothing. Anthony Lewis is a
bellwether, because he was their most extreme critic. More than a
year after the Tet Offensive, in mid-1969, Anthony Lewis was the
<i>Times</i>&rsquo;s Bureau Chief in London, and at that point he was
unwilling even to <i>speak</i> to people in the American peace
movement. I remember this personally. I was in Oxford in the spring
of 1969 as John Locke Lecturer, and I was all over the British media
talking about the war. Some of the British anti-war groups tried to
get Anthony Lewis just to have a private discussion with me&mdash;he
wouldn&rsquo;t do it, said he&rsquo;s not going to talk to anyone
connected with this peace movement. And this wasn&rsquo;t even in the
United States, it was in <i>England,</i> where the pressures and the
political climate were different. Finally by late 1969, he did begin
to write mildly critical stuff about the war. Then he went to  North
Vietnam and discovered that bombs actually hurt: you walk through
Haiphong, you see a lot of buildings knocked down, people torn apart;
big surprise. At that point Anthony Lewis started to write critical
material about the war&mdash;but bear in mind that that&rsquo;s about
a year and a half after corporate America turned against the war.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take the My Lai
massacre [the March 1968 shooting of 504 unarmed Vietnamese civilians
by an American Army unit], which became a big issue in the United
States. When? My Lai became a big issue in November 1969&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a year and a half after the killings took place, and about a year and
a half after corporate America had turned against the war. And of
course, My Lai was a triviality&mdash;it was such a triviality that
the peace movement knew about it right away and didn&rsquo;t even
talk about it. Like, the Quakers in Quang Ngai Province where it took
place [working with the American Friends Service Committee] didn&rsquo;t
even bother reporting it&mdash;because the same sort of thing was
happening all over the place.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">79</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Life
magazine made My Lai famous.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">80</font></sup></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">My Lai, they did&mdash;but
first of all, note the timing: it&rsquo;s a year and a half after it
happened, a year and a half after corporate America turned against
the war. And the reporting was falsified. See, My Lai was presented
as if it was a bunch of crazy grunts who got out of control because
they were being directed by this Lieutenant Calley, who was kind of a
madman. <i>That</i> you can handle. But that&rsquo;s not what My Lai
was about. My Lai was a footnote, My Lai was an uninteresting
footnote to a military operation called Operation WHEELER
WALLAWA&mdash;which was a huge mass-murder operation, in which B-52
raids were targeted right on villages. That wasn&rsquo;t Lieutenant
Calley, that was a guy in Washington plotting out coordinates. You
know what a B-52 raid is? That means wipe out everything&mdash;and it
was targeted right on villages. In comparison to that, My Lai doesn&rsquo;t
exist.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, there was a
military commission that reviewed My Lai, the Piers Commission, and
their most dramatic finding was that there were massacres like My Lai
all over the place. For instance, they found another massacre in My
Khe, which is about four kilometers down the road&mdash;everywhere
they looked they found another massacre. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">81</font></sup>
Well, what does that tell you? What does that suggest to you, if
everywhere you look you find a My Lai? Well, it suggests something,
but what it suggests was never brought out in the media.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s not

such thing as a &ldquo;volunteer army&rdquo;: a &ldquo;volunteer
army&rdquo; is a mercenary army of the poor. Take a look at the
Marines&mdash;what you see is black faces, from the ghettos.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, and the
officers are white, of course. That&rsquo;s like South Africa: the
officers are white, the grunts who actually carry out most of the
atrocities in places like Namibia are black.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">82</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s the way empires have always been run. And sometime in
the Seventies, the American army shifted to a traditional mercenary
army of the poor, which they call a &ldquo;volunteer army.&rdquo;
People in power learn, you know. They&rsquo;re sophisticated, and
they&rsquo;re organized, and they have continuity&mdash;and they
realize that they made a mistake in Vietnam. They don&rsquo;t want to
make that same mistake again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And as for the <i>New
York Times</i> being anti-war&mdash;well, we <i>thought</i> of it as
anti-war at the time, but that was because our standard was so low.
Nowadays we would consider that same sort of &ldquo;criticism&rdquo;
to be pro-war. And that&rsquo;s just another reflection of the
increase in political consciousness and sophistication in the general
population over the last twenty years. If you look back at the <i>Times</i>
in those days, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll find I think.</p>

Chomsky, it seems the terms of political discourse themselves are a
tool for propagandizing the population. How is language used to
prevent us from understanding and to disempower us?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the
terminology we use is heavily ideologically laden, always. Pick your
term: if it&rsquo;s a term that has any significance whatsoever&mdash;like,
not &ldquo;and&rdquo; or &ldquo;or&rdquo;&mdash;it typically has two
meanings, a dictionary meaning and a meaning that&rsquo;s used for
ideological warfare. So, &ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; is only what other
people do. What&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Communism&rdquo; is supposed to
be &ldquo;the far left&#65533;&#65533;: in my view, it&rsquo;s the
far <i>right,</i> basically indistinguishable from fascism. These
guys that everybody calls &ldquo;conservative,&rdquo; any
conservative would turn over in their grave at the sight of
them&mdash;they&rsquo;re extreme statists, they&rsquo;re not
&ldquo;conservative&rdquo; in any traditional meaning of the word.
&ldquo;Special interests&rdquo; means labor, women, blacks, the poor,
the elderly, the young&mdash;in other words, the general population.
There&rsquo;s only one sector of the population that <i>doesn&rsquo;t</i>
ever get mentioned as a &ldquo;special interest,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s
corporations, and business in general&mdash;because they&rsquo;re the
&ldquo;<i>national</i> interest.&rdquo; Or take &ldquo;defense&rdquo;:
I have never heard of a state that admits it&rsquo;s carrying out an
aggressive act, they&rsquo;re always engaged in &ldquo;defense,&rdquo;
no matter what they&rsquo;re doing&mdash;maybe &ldquo;preemptive
defense&rdquo; or something.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or look at the major
theme of modern American history, &ldquo;containment&rdquo;&mdash;as
in, &ldquo;the United States is containing Soviet expansionism.&rdquo;
Unless you accept that framework of discussion when talking about
international affairs in the modern period, you are just not a part
of accepted discourse here: everybody has to begin by assuming that
for the last half-century the United States has been &ldquo;containing&rdquo;
the Soviet Union.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the rhetoric
of &ldquo;containment&rdquo; begs all questions&mdash;once you&rsquo;ve
accepted the rhetoric of &ldquo;containment,&rdquo; it really doesn&rsquo;t
matter what you say, you&rsquo;ve already given up everything.
Because the fundamental question is, is it true? Has the United
States been &ldquo;containing&rdquo; the Soviet Union? Well, you
know, on the surface it looks a little odd. I mean, maybe you think
the Soviet Union is the worst place in history, but they&rsquo;re
conservative&mdash;whatever rotten things they&rsquo;ve done, they&rsquo;ve
been inside the Soviet Union and right around its borders, in Eastern
Europe and Afghanistan and so on. They never do anything anywhere
else. They don&rsquo;t have troops stationed anywhere else. They
don&rsquo;t have intervention forces positioned all over the world
like we do.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">1</font></sup>
So what does it mean to say we&rsquo;re &ldquo;containing&rdquo;
them?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We&rsquo;ve been
talking about the media and dumping on them, so why not turn to
scholarship? Diplomatic history&rsquo;s a big field, people win big
prizes, get fancy professorships. Well, if you look at diplomatic
history, it too is in the framework of &ldquo;containment,&rdquo;
even the so-called dissidents. I mean, <i>everybody</i> has to accept
the premise of &ldquo;containment,&rdquo; or you simply will not have
an opportunity to proceed in these fields. And in the footnotes of
the professional literature on containment, often there are some
revealing things said.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For example, one of
the major scholarly books on the Cold War is called <i>Strategies of
Containment</i>, by John Lewis Gaddis&mdash;it&rsquo;s the foremost
scholarly study by the top diplomatic historian, so it&rsquo;s worth
taking a look at. Well, in discussing this great theme, &ldquo;strategies
of containment,&rdquo; Gaddis begins by talking about the
terminology. He says at the beginning: it&rsquo;s true that the term
&ldquo;containment&rdquo; begs some questions, yes it presupposes
some things, but nevertheless, despite the question of whether it&rsquo;s
factually accurate, it still is proper to adopt it as the framework
for discussion. And the reason why it&rsquo;s proper is because it
was the <i>perception</i> of American leaders that they were taking a
defensive position against the Soviet Union&mdash;so, Gaddis
concludes, since that was the perception of American leaders, and
since we&rsquo;re studying American history, it&rsquo;s fair to
continue in that framework. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">2</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, just suppose
some diplomatic historian tried that with the Nazis. Suppose somebody
were to write a book about German history and say, &ldquo;Well, look,
Hitler and his advisors certainly <i>perceived</i> their position as
defensive&rdquo;&mdash;which is absolutely true: Germany was under
&ldquo;attack&rdquo; by the Jews, remember. Go back and look at the
Nazi literature, they had to defend themselves against this virus,
this bacillus that was eating away at the core of modern
civilization&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve got to defend yourself, after
all. And they were under &ldquo;attack&rdquo; by the Czechs, and by
the Poles, and by European encirclement. That&rsquo;s not a joke. In
fact, they had a better argument there than we do with the Soviet
Union&mdash;they <i>were</i> encircled, and &ldquo;contained,&rdquo;
and they had this enormous Versailles debt stuck on them for no
reason after World War I. Okay, so suppose somebody wrote a book
saying: &ldquo;Look, the Nazi leadership <i>perceived</i> themselves
as taking a defensive  stance against external and internal
aggression; it&rsquo;s true it begs some questions, but we&rsquo;ll
proceed that way&mdash;now we&rsquo;ll talk about how they defended
themselves against the Jews by building Auschwitz, and how they
defended themselves against the Czechs by invading Czechoslovakia,
how they defended themselves against the Poles, and so on.&rdquo; If
anybody tried to do that, you wouldn&rsquo;t even bother to laugh&mdash;but
about the United States, that&rsquo;s the <i>only</i> thing you can
say: it&rsquo;s not just that it&rsquo;s <i>acceptable,</i> it&rsquo;s
that anything else is <i>unacceptable.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And when you pursue
the matter further, it becomes even more interesting. So for example,
in this same book Gaddis points out&mdash;again, in sort of a
footnote, an aside he doesn&rsquo;t elaborate on&mdash;that it&rsquo;s
a striking fact that when you look over the American diplomatic
record since World War II, all of our decisions about how to contain
the Soviet Union, like the arms buildups, the shifts to d&eacute;tente,
all those things, reflected largely domestic economic considerations.
Then he sort of drops the point.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">3</font></sup>
Well, what does that mean? What does Gaddis mean by that? There he&rsquo;s
beginning to enter into the realm of truth. See, the truth of the
matter, and it&rsquo;s very well-supported by declassified documents
and other evidence, is that military spending is our method of
industrial management&mdash;it&rsquo;s our way of keeping the economy
profitable for business. So just take a look at the major
declassified documents on military spending, they&rsquo;re pretty
frank about it. For example, N.S.C. 68 [National Security Council
Memorandum 68] is the major Cold War document, as everybody agrees,
and one of the things it says very clearly is that without military
spending, there&rsquo;s going to be an economic decline both in the
United States and world-wide&mdash;so consequently it calls for a
vast increase in military spending in the U.S., in addition to
breaking up the Soviet Union.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">4</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You have to remember
the context in which these decisions were being made, after all. This
was right after the Marshall Plan had failed, right after the
post-war aid programs had failed. There still had been no success as
yet in reconstructing either the Japanese or Western European
economies&mdash;and American business needed them; American
manufacturers needed those export markets desperately. See, the
Marshall Plan was designed largely as an export-promotion operation
for American business, not as the noblest effort in history and so
on. But it had failed: we hadn&rsquo;t rebuilt the industrial powers
we needed as allies and reconstructed the markets we needed for
exports. And at that point, military spending was considered the one
thing that could really do it, it was seen as the engine that could
drive economic growth after the wartime boom ended, and prevent the
U.S. from slipping back into a depression.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">5</font></sup>
And it worked: military spending was a big stimulus to the U.S.
economy, and it led to the rebuilding of Japanese industry, and the
rebuilding of European industry&mdash;and in fact, it has continued
to be our mode of industrial management right up to the present. So
in that little comment Gaddis was getting near the main story: he was
saying, post-war American decisions on rearmament and d&eacute;tente
have been keyed  to domestic economic considerations&mdash;but then
he drops it, and we go back to talking about &ldquo;containment&rdquo;
again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And if you look
still closer at the scholarship on &ldquo;containment,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s
even more intriguing. For example, in another book Gaddis discusses
the American military intervention in the Soviet Union right after
the Bolshevik Revolution&mdash;when we tried to overthrow the new
Bolshevik government by force&mdash;and he says <i>that</i> was
defensive and <i>that</i> was containment: our invasion of the
Russian land mass. And remember, I&rsquo;m not talking about some
right-wing historian; this is the major, most respected, liberal
diplomatic historian, the dean of the field: he says the military
intervention by 13 Western nations in the Soviet Union in 1918 was a
&ldquo;defensive&rdquo; act. And why was it defensive? Well, there&rsquo;s
a sense in which he&rsquo;s right. He says it was &ldquo;defensive&rdquo;
because the Bolsheviks had declared a challenge to the existing order
throughout the West, they had offered a challenge to Western
capitalism&mdash;and naturally we had to defend ourselves. And the
only way we could defend ourselves was by sending troops to Russia,
so that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; invasion, that&rsquo;s
&ldquo;defense.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">6</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And if you look at
that history in more detail, you&rsquo;ll find the point is even more
revealing. So for example, right after the Bolshevik Revolution,
American Secretary of State Robert Lansing warned President Wilson
that the Bolsheviks are &ldquo;issuing an appeal to the proletariat
of all nations, to the illiterate and mentally deficient, who by
their very numbers are supposed to take control of all governments.&rdquo;
And since they&rsquo;re issuing an appeal to the mass of the
population in other countries to take control of their own affairs,
and since that mass of the population are the &ldquo;mentally
deficient&rdquo; and the &ldquo;illiterate&rdquo;&mdash;you know, all
these poor slobs out there who have to be kept in their place, for
their own good&mdash;that&rsquo;s an attack on us, and therefore we
have to defend ourselves.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">7</font></sup>
And what Wilson actually <i>did</i> was to &ldquo;defend ourselves&rdquo;
in the two obvious ways: first by invading Russia to try to prevent
that challenge from being issued, and second by initiating the Red
Scare at home [a 1919 campaign of U.S. government repression and
propaganda against &ldquo;Communists&rdquo;] to crush the threat that
anyone here might answer the appeal. Those were both a part of the
same intervention, the same &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; intervention.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And it&rsquo;s the
same right up until today. Why do we have to get rid of the
Sandinistas in Nicaragua? In reality it&rsquo;s not because anybody
really thinks that they&rsquo;re a Communist power about to conquer
the Hemisphere&mdash;it&rsquo;s because they were carrying out social
programs that were beginning to succeed, and which would have
appealed to other people in Latin America who want the same things.
In 1980 the World Bank estimated that it would take Nicaragua ten
years just to get back to the economic level it had in <i>1977,</i>
because of the vast destruction inflicted at the end of the Somoza
reign [the four-decade Nicaraguan family dictatorship ousted by the
Sandinista revolution in July 1979]. But nevertheless, under the
Sandinista government Nicaragua was in fact beginning economic
development: it was  establishing health programs, and social
programs, and things were starting to improve for the general
population there.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">8</font></sup>
Well, that set off the alarm bells in New York and Washington, like
it always does, and we had to stop it&mdash;because it was issuing an
appeal to the &ldquo;illiterate and mentally deficient&rdquo; in
other desperate countries, like Honduras and Guatemala, to do the
same thing. That&rsquo;s what U.S. planners call the &ldquo;domino
theory,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;threat of a good example,&rdquo; and
pretty soon the whole U.S.-dominated system starts to fall apart.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">9</font></sup></p>

</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, all of that is
within the rhetoric of &ldquo;containing&rdquo; Communism&mdash;and
we could easily go on. But there&rsquo;s one word. You look at any
other term of political discourse, and you&rsquo;re going to find the
same thing: the terms of political discourse are designed so as to
prevent thought. One of the main ones is this notion of &ldquo;defense.&rdquo;
So look at the diplomatic record of any country you want&mdash;Nazi
Germany, the Soviet Union, Libya, pick your favorite
horror-story&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find that everything they ever did
was &ldquo;defensive&rdquo;; I&rsquo;m sure if we had records from
Genghis Khan we would find that what he was doing was &ldquo;defensive&rdquo;
too. And here in the United States you cannot challenge that&mdash;no
matter how absurd it gets.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Like, we can be
&ldquo;defending&rdquo; South Vietnam. I have never seen in the
media, <i>never</i> in thirty years that I have been looking
carefully, one phrase even suggesting that we were not defending
South Vietnam. Now, we weren&rsquo;t: we were <i>attacking</i> South
Vietnam. We were attacking South Vietnam as clearly as any aggression
in history. But try to find one phrase anywhere in any American
newspaper, outside of real marginal publications, just stating that
elementary fact. It&rsquo;s unstatable.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">10</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s
unstatable in the scholarly literature. Gaddis again, when he talks
about the battle of Dienbienphu, where the French made their last
stand to keep colonial control over Indochina, he describes it as a
defensive struggle. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">11</font></sup>
McGeorge Bundy, in his book on the history of the military system,
talks about how the United States toyed with the idea of using
nuclear weapons in 1954 to help the French maintain their position at
Dienbienphu, and he says: we were thinking about it to assist the
French in their &ldquo;defense&rdquo; of Indochina.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">12</font></sup>
He doesn&rsquo;t say defense against <i>whom</i>, you know, because
that would be too idiotic&mdash;like, was it defense against the
Russians or something? No. They were defending Indochina against the
<i>Indochinese.</i> <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">13</font></sup>
But no matter how absurd it is, you cannot question that in the
United States. I mean, these are extremes of ideological
fanaticism&mdash;in other countries, you could at least <i>raise</i>
these kinds of questions. Some of you are journalists: try talking
about the American &ldquo;attack&rdquo; on South Vietnam. Your
editors will think you came from Mars or something, there was no such
event in history. Of course, there <i>was</i> in real history.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take the idea
that the United States is supporting &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; all over
the world. Well, there&rsquo;s a sense in which that&rsquo;s true.
But what does it mean? When we support &ldquo;democracy,&rdquo; what
do we support? I mean, is &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; something where the
population takes part in running the country? Well, obviously not.
For instance, why are El Salvador and Guatemala &ldquo;democratic,&rdquo;
but Nicaragua [i.e. under the Sandinista Party] not &ldquo;democratic&rdquo;?
Why? Is it because two of them had elections and the other one
didn&rsquo;t? No. In fact, Nicaragua&rsquo;s election [in 1984] was a
hundred times as good as any election in El Salvador.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">14</font></sup>
Is it because there&rsquo;s a lack of popular political participation
in Nicaragua? No. Is it because the political opposition can&rsquo;t
survive there? No, the political opposition is barely harassed in
Nicaragua; in El Salvador and Guatemala it&rsquo;s just murdered.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">15</font></sup>
Is it that there can&rsquo;t be an independent press in Nicaragua?
No, the Nicaraguan press is one of the freest presses in the world,
much more so than the <i>American</i> press has ever been&mdash;the
United States has never tolerated a newspaper even <i>remotely</i>
like <i>La Prensa</i> in Nicaragua [opposition paper supported by the
U.S. during the contra war], not even close: in any time of crisis
here, the American government has shut down even tiny dissident
newspapers, forget a major newspaper funded by the foreign power
that&rsquo;s attacking the country and which is openly calling for
the overthrow of the government.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">16</font></sup>
That degree of freedom of the press is absolutely inconceivable here.
In El Salvador, there <i>was</i> an independent press at one time&mdash;it
was wiped out by the U.S.-backed security forces, who just murdered
the editor of one newspaper and blew up the premises of the other. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">17</font></sup>
Okay, that takes care of that independent press.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you know, by what
criteria are El Salvador and Guatemala &ldquo;democratic&rdquo; and
Nicaragua not? Well, there <i>is</i> a criterion: in Nicaragua [under
the Sandinistas], business elements are not represented in dominating
the state much beyond their numbers, so it&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;democracy.&rdquo;
In El Salvador and Guatemala, the governments are run by the military
for the benefit of the local oligarchies&mdash;the landowners, rich
businessmen, and rising professionals&mdash;and those people are tied
up with the United States, so therefore those countries <i>are</i>
&ldquo;democracies.&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t matter if they blow up
the independent press, and kill off the political opposition, and
slaughter tens of thousands of people, and never run anything
remotely like a free election&mdash;all of that is totally
irrelevant. They&rsquo;re &ldquo;democracies,&rdquo; because the
right people are running them; if the right people <i>aren&rsquo;t</i>
running them, then they&rsquo;re not &ldquo;democracies.&rdquo; And
on this again there is uniformity: try to find anyone in the American
press, <i>anyone</i>, who is willing to break ranks on the idea that
there are four democracies in Central America and one totalitarian
state [i.e. Sandinista Nicaragua] that never had a free election&mdash;just
try to find one statement rebutting that. And if the killings in El
Salvador and Guatemala <i>are</i> ever mentioned in the American
press, they&rsquo;ll always call it &ldquo;Death Squads Out of
Control,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Extremists Out of Control.&rdquo; Now, the
fact of the matter is that the extremists are in Washington, and what
they&rsquo;re  controlling are the Salvadoran and Guatemalan
militaries&mdash;but you&rsquo;ll never find <i>that</i> in an
American newspaper.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or just take this
phrase &ldquo;peace process,&rdquo; which we hear all the time. The
phrase &ldquo;peace process&rdquo; has a dictionary meaning, it means
&ldquo;process leading to peace.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s not the way
it&rsquo;s used in the media. The term &ldquo;peace process&rdquo; is
used in the media to refer to whatever the United States happens to
be doing at the moment&mdash;and again, that is without exception. So
it turns out that the United States is <i>always</i> supporting the
peace process, by definition. Just try to find a phrase in the U.S.
media somewhere, anywhere, saying that the United States is opposing
the peace process: you can&rsquo;t do it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, a few
months ago I said this at a talk in Seattle, and someone from the
audience wrote me a letter about a week or so later saying he was
interested, so he&rsquo;d done a little research project on it. He
took the <i>New York Times</i> computer database from 1980 (when it
begins) up to the present, and pulled out every article that had the
words &ldquo;peace process&rdquo; in it. There were like nine hundred
articles or something, and he checked through each of them to see if
there was any case in which the United States was opposing the peace
process. And there wasn&rsquo;t, it was 100 percent. Well, you know,
even the most august country in history, let&rsquo;s say by accident
sometime, might not be supporting the peace process. But in the case
of the United States, that just can&rsquo;t happen. And this is a
particularly striking illustration, because during the 1980s the
United States was the main factor in blocking two major international
peace processes, one in Central America and one in the Middle East.
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">18</font></sup> But just
try to find that simple, obvious fact stated anywhere in the
mainstream media. You can&rsquo;t. And you can&rsquo;t because it&rsquo;s
a logical contradiction&mdash;you don&rsquo;t even have to do any
grubby work with the data and the documents to prove it, it&rsquo;s
just proven by the meaning of the words themselves. It&rsquo;s like
finding a married bachelor or something&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have to
do any research to show there aren&rsquo;t any. You can&rsquo;t have
the United States opposing the peace process, because the peace
process is what the United States is <i>doing</i>, by definition. And
if anybody is opposing the United States, then <i>they&rsquo;re</i>
opposing the peace process. That&rsquo;s the way it works, and it&rsquo;s
very convenient, you get nice conclusions.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;
is a word that means &ldquo;follows U.S. orders&rdquo;&mdash;as
opposed to what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;radical,&rdquo; which means
&ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t follow U.S. orders.&rdquo; &ldquo;Radical&rdquo;
has nothing to do with left or right; you can be an
ultra-right-winger, but you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;radical&rdquo; if you
don&rsquo;t follow U.S. orders.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I have yet
to see a single reference to Morocco&rsquo;s King Hassan as an
&ldquo;absolute monarch.&rdquo; He has the worst human rights record
in the Arab world, torture widespread, he invaded Western Sahara,
disobeyed the World Court, one of the nastiest characters anywhere&mdash;I
have never seen an article that didn&rsquo;t refer to him as a
&ldquo;moderate.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">19</font></sup></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s right,
because we have U.S. airbases in Morocco, and we get plenty of
minerals from there, and so on. Or just take Saudi Arabia&mdash;Saudi
Arabia is even described as &ldquo;moderate&rdquo; now. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">20</font></sup>
In fact, even <i>Iraq</i> is sometimes described as &ldquo;moving
towards moderation&rdquo;: Iraq is probably the worst terror-state in
the world&mdash;death camps, biological warfare, anything you like.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">21</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: How about
Suharto [Indonesian dictator]&mdash;he&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;
too.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Suharto, yeah&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the most extreme case I&rsquo;ve ever seen, in fact, I&rsquo;m glad
you mention it. This is a really astonishing one, actually. For
example, there was an article in the <i>Christian Science Monitor</i>
a couple years ago about the great business opportunities in
Indonesia, and it said: after the Indonesian government stopped a
Communist revolt in 1965, the West was very eager to do business with
Indonesia&rsquo;s &ldquo;new moderate leader, Suharto.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">22</font></sup>
Well, who&rsquo;s Indonesia&rsquo;s &ldquo;new moderate leader,
Suharto&rdquo;? Suharto is the guy who, no doubt with the backing of
the United States, carried out a military coup in 1965 after which
the Indonesian army slaughtered about 500,000 people within four
months. Nobody knows the exact numbers&mdash;I mean, <i>they</i> gave
500,000, pick your number; it was mostly landless peasants.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">23</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that was very
much welcomed in the West, the American media just loved it. For
instance, James Reston, the <i>New York Times</i>&rsquo;s liberal
columnist, had a column I remember called, &ldquo;A Gleam of Light in
Asia&rdquo;&mdash;things are really looking up. <i>U.S. News and
World Report</i> had a story called, &ldquo;Hope Where There Once Was
None.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">24</font></sup>
These were the kinds of headlines that were running throughout the
U.S. press&mdash;and the reason was, Suharto had wiped out the only
mass-based political party in Indonesia, the Communist Party, which
had about fourteen million members at the time. The <i>Times</i> had
an editorial saying basically: it&rsquo;s all great stuff, but the
United States is right not to become too openly involved, because it
doesn&rsquo;t look too good to wipe out 500,000 people&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
going the right way, let&rsquo;s make sure it keeps going the right
way. This was right at the time of the massacre.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">25</font></sup>
Well, that&rsquo;s Indonesia&rsquo;s &ldquo;new moderate leader,&rdquo;
Suharto. This is probably the most extreme case I&rsquo;ve ever seen:
this guy is one of the biggest mass murderers since Adolf Hitler.</p>

Poverty<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, I
want to change gears for a moment if we could. You&rsquo;ve said that
you were politically aware as a young kid in the 1930s&mdash;I&rsquo;m
wondering, do you have any impressions of the differences between
that time and today, in terms of general outlook and attitudes? How
would you compare the two periods?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the Thirties
were an exciting time&mdash;it was deep economic depression,
everybody was out of a job, but the funny thing about it was, it was
hopeful. It&rsquo;s very different today. When you go into the slums
today, it&rsquo;s nothing like what it was: it&rsquo;s desolate,
there is no hope. Anybody who&rsquo;s my age or more will remember,
there was a sense of hopefulness back then: maybe there was no food,
but there were possibilities, there were things that could be done.
You take a walk through East Harlem today, there was nothing like
that at the depths of the Depression&mdash;this sense that there&rsquo;s
nothing you can do, it&rsquo;s hopeless, your grandmother has to stay
up at night to keep you from being eaten by a rat. That kind of thing
didn&rsquo;t exist at the depths of the Depression; I don&rsquo;t
even think it existed out in rural areas. Kids didn&rsquo;t come into
school without food; teachers didn&rsquo;t have to worry that when
they walked out into the hall, they might get killed by some guy high
on drugs&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t <i>that</i> bad.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There&rsquo;s really
something qualitatively different about contemporary poverty, I
think. Some of you must share these experiences. I mean, I was a kid
back then, so maybe my perspective was different. But I remember when
I would go into the apartment of my cousins&mdash;you know, broken
family, no job, twenty people living in a tiny apartment&mdash;somehow
it was hopeful. It was intellectually alive, it was exciting, it was
just very different from today somehow.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Do you
attribute that to the raised political consciousness of that era as
compared to now?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s possible:
there was a lot of union organizing back then, and the struggles were
very brutal. I remember it well. Like, one of my earliest childhood
memories is of taking a trolley car with my mother and seeing the
police wade into a strike of women pickets outside a Philadelphia
textile mill, and beating them up&mdash;that&rsquo;s a searing
memory. And the poverty was extreme: I remember rag-pickers coming to
the door begging for money, lots of things like that. So it was not
pretty by any means. But it was also not hopeless. Somehow that&rsquo;s
a tremendous difference: the slums are now hopeless, there&rsquo;s
nothing to do except prey on one another.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, a lot of
life is hopeless today, even for middle-class kids. I mean, for the
first time in I think human history, middle-class kids now assume
they are not going to live as well as their parents&mdash;that&rsquo;s
really something  new, that&rsquo;s never happened before.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">26</font></sup>
My kids, for example, assume that they are probably not going to live
the way that we live. Think about it, that&rsquo;s never happened
before in history. And they&rsquo;re probably right, except
accidentally&mdash;like, some of them may, but on average they won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Do you have
an explanation of what&rsquo;s happened to the cities?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I don&rsquo;t
entirely understand it, to tell you the truth.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">27</font></sup>
You could see it beginning in the late 1940s&mdash;New York City, for
example, started to become a hostile place around then. I mean, as a
kid when I would go to New York, I would think nothing of walking
through Central Park alone at night, or walking along Riverside Drive
by the river alone at night&mdash;the kinds of things you wouldn&rsquo;t
do now without a platoon of Marines around you, you just took for
granted back then; you didn&rsquo;t even give it a second thought.
You never thought twice about taking a walk through Harlem, let&rsquo;s
say&mdash;what the heck, you know? But that all began to change after
the Second World War, and it changed throughout the whole United
States: cities just became hostile.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, New York
always had the <i>reputation</i> of being hostile, like there were
always jokes about the guy lying in the street and everybody walking
over him. But you just didn&rsquo;t feel that you were taking your
life into your hands and that people there were going to kill you,
the sense you get when you walk through a lot of the city today. And
also, you didn&rsquo;t have the same sense of super-wealth right next
to grinding poverty&mdash;like today you see people sitting at a
fancy restaurant drinking wine, and some homeless person lying on the
street right in front of them. There wasn&rsquo;t quite that kind of
thing either.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Is the
change maybe related to the internationalization of the economy, and
the broadening of the super-rich class here?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Maybe. I really
don&rsquo;t know, to tell you the truth, and I don&rsquo;t want to
pretend that I know. But my feeling is, it&rsquo;s beyond just
economics. I mean, there were radical differences in wealth at that
time, and people in the slums were extremely poor&mdash;it&rsquo;s
just that they weren&rsquo;t desolate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: It wasn&rsquo;t
such a consumer culture at the time.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, certainly not
to the extent that it is now&mdash;like, everybody didn&rsquo;t have
a television set where they were seeing some impossible life in front
of their eyes all the time. Although you had something like it, don&rsquo;t
forget: in those days the movies were what television is today; you&rsquo;d
go to the movies for a dime, and that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;d get
your fantasy world. And the movies were all glitter, all upper-class
fake glitter. But it just didn&rsquo;t have the same  devastating
effect, I don&rsquo;t know why. There&rsquo;s something really
hopeless about contemporary life that&rsquo;s new, I think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: The bomb had
a lot to do with it.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Maybe&mdash;but does
that really account for what happens in the slums? Look, I mean, I
never see much of it. In the late 1960s, I was with a mainly white
group, RESIST [a national draft-resistance movement], but we had good
contacts with the Black Panthers, and with them I did get into slum
areas. In general, though, I don&rsquo;t tend to see the slums very
much. But from the few times I&rsquo;ve walked around poor areas of
Harlem and other places like that since then, I just can&rsquo;t
recall anything remotely like it in the 1930s, even in the poorest
parts of Brownsville [a low-income section of Brooklyn]. Also, older
friends of mine who&rsquo;ve been teachers in New York since the
1920s tell me they think it&rsquo;s totally different today as
well&mdash;kids were poor in the Thirties, but they weren&rsquo;t
rat-bitten.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: For
myself, as a radical who does a lot of political work in my
community, the despair is unbelievable&mdash;what we have to fight
against at the lowest rung is just incredible, I can really
understand just giving up. Don&rsquo;t you have some explanation of
how we&rsquo;ve come to this point?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I think if you
look over American history, you can point to at least a few factors
behind it. This is an immigrant society, and before the Depression
virtually every wave of immigrants who came here was more or less
absorbed, at least the ones who wanted to stay&mdash;a lot of them
didn&rsquo;t, remember; in fact, the rate of return was rather high
during the peak periods of immigration.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">28</font></sup>
But for the immigrants who did stay, the United States really <i>was</i>
a land of opportunity. So, my father could come from Russia and work
in a sweatshop, and manage finally to get to college, and then see
his son become a professor&mdash;that stuff was real. And it was real
because there was a lot of manual labor around which could absorb the
waves of immigrants: people could work in sweatshops for sixteen
hours a day and make enough to live on, then accumulate a little
excess, and things would gradually start to get better. But in the
1930s, there was a big break in this system&mdash;the Depression
ended those opportunities. And the United States has basically never
gotten out of the Depression.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, the post-World
War II economic boom has been a different sort of economic growth
from anything that ever happened before. For one thing, it&rsquo;s
been basically state-funded and primarily centered in high
technology-based industries, which are tied to the military system.
And that kind of economic growth just does not allow for absorbing
new waves of immigrants. It allowed for it briefly during the Second
World War, when there was a labor shortage and people could come off
the farms in the South and work in the war industries. But that
ended. And since then, the jobs have  mostly been in high-tech or in
the service sector&mdash;which is rotten, you don&rsquo;t go
anywhere. So there just aren&rsquo;t the same possibilities for
people to move up: if you can get into high-tech industry, you
probably were there already, and if you&rsquo;re working at sweeping
the streets or something, that&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re going to
stay.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, maybe that
situation would have been livable if there hadn&rsquo;t been a new
wave of immigration, but there was. There was a huge wave of
immigration. It happened to have been <i>internal</i> immigration
this time, but from the point of view of the society it was like a
foreign wave: it came from rapid mechanization of agriculture in the
South, which drove the black population, the former slaves, off the
land. Then on top of that, there&rsquo;s also been a major influx of
Hispanic immigration. So you had these two big waves of immigration
coming up to the Northern cities, and nothing for them to do: they
couldn&rsquo;t do what my father did, because there wasn&rsquo;t the
same kind of manual labor going on which could occupy millions more
workers. So what in fact happened is these two huge waves of
immigrants were just herded into concentration camps, which we happen
to call &ldquo;cities.&rdquo; And the vast majority of them are never
going to get out&mdash;just because there&rsquo;s nothing for them to
do. The economy simply is not growing; I mean, the Gross National
Product goes up, but it goes up in a way which does not constitute
economic growth for a poor urban population.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And with the decline
of the traditional manufacturing industries in recent years, it&rsquo;s
getting worse, not better. As capital becomes more fluid and it
becomes easier for corporations to move production to the Third
World, why should they pay higher wages in Detroit when they can pay
lower wages in Northern Mexico or the Philippines? And the result is,
there&rsquo;s even more pressure on the poorer part of the population
here. And what&rsquo;s in effect happened is they&rsquo;ve been
closed off into inner-city slums&mdash;where then all sorts of other
pressures begin to attack them: drugs, gentrification, police
repression, cutbacks in limited welfare programs, and so on. And all
of these things contribute to creating a very authentic sense of
hopelessness, and also to real anti-social behavior: crime. And the
crime is mostly poor people preying on one another, the statistics
show that very clearly&mdash;because the rich are locked away behind
their barricades.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">29</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You can see it very
clearly when you drive through New York now: the differences in
wealth are like San Salvador. I mean, I was giving a talk there a
little while ago, and as you walk around it&rsquo;s kind of dramatic:
there are these castles, and there are guards at the gate, and a
limousine drives up and the people go inside; inside I guess it&rsquo;s
very elegant and beautiful. But it&rsquo;s like living in a feudal
system, with a lot of wild barbarians outside&mdash;except if you&rsquo;re
rich, you don&rsquo;t ever see them, you just move between your
castle and your limousine. And if you&rsquo;re poor, you&rsquo;ve got
no castle to protect you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You
mentioned drugs having an impact on the problem&mdash;I&rsquo;m
wondering whether you agree with the theory that drugs were maybe
introduced  to the ghettos intentionally, to try to demoralize people
there and keep them from coming together to organize to change
things?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s a good
question&mdash;activists who work in the ghettos and slums have been
charging that for years. I mean, a lot of people have pointed out
that just at the time when you started to get serious organizing in
the urban ghettos in the 1960s, all of a sudden there was this huge
flow of drugs which absolutely devastated the inner-city communities.
And the communities just couldn&rsquo;t defend themselves against it:
the parents couldn&rsquo;t do it, the churches couldn&rsquo;t do it,
you&rsquo;ve got guys hanging around on street corners giving
ten-year-olds free drugs, and in a couple of months the
neighborhood&rsquo;s gone. And the timing, in fact, <i>was</i> about
when serious political organizing was beginning to take place. Beyond
that, I don&rsquo;t know: maybe it was planned, maybe it just
happened.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">30</font></sup>
But I think you can make a good case that the way the criminal
justice system has been set up ever since then <i>does</i> have a lot
to do with social control.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So just take a look
at the different prosecution rates and sentencing rules for ghetto
drugs like crack and suburban drugs like cocaine, or for drunk
drivers and drug users, or just between blacks and whites in
general&mdash;the statistics are clear: this is a war on the poor and
minorities.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">31</font></sup>
Or ask yourself a simple question: how come marijuana is illegal but
tobacco legal? It can&rsquo;t be because of the health impact,
because that&rsquo;s exactly the other way around&mdash;there has
never been a fatality from marijuana use among 60 million reported
users in the United States, whereas tobacco kills hundreds of
thousands of people every year.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">32</font></sup>
My strong suspicion, though I don&rsquo;t know how to prove it, is
that the reason is that marijuana&rsquo;s a weed, you can grow it in
your backyard, so there&rsquo;s nobody who would make any money off
it if it were legal. Tobacco requires extensive capital inputs and
technology, and it can be monopolized, so there are people who can
make a ton of money off it. I don&rsquo;t really see any other
difference between the two of them, frankly&mdash;except that
tobacco&rsquo;s far more lethal and far more addictive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But it&rsquo;s
certainly true that a lot of inner-city communities have just been
devastated by drugs. And you can see why people would want them&mdash;they
do give you a sense of temporary relief from an intolerable
existence, whatever else they might do. Plus I&rsquo;m just convinced
that by now a lot of the drug stuff is around mainly because people
can make money off it&mdash;so I don&rsquo;t really think there&rsquo;s
much hope for dealing with the problem without some form of
decriminalization to remove that incentive. It&rsquo;s not a pretty
solution, but it&rsquo;s probably part of the solution, I suspect.
And of course, decriminalization doesn&rsquo;t have to mean <i>no</i>
regulation&mdash;like, in England over the years, they&rsquo;ve tried
to regulate alcohol through tax policies and so on, to encourage use
of more benign products like beer rather than more dangerous ones,
and something like that could be looked into here. But obviously
something should be tried, I think.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8546_2032848809"></a>Religious
Fanaticism<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN:
Fundamentalist religion has really taken off in the last decade,
maybe as an outlet for some of this despair. Do you have any thoughts
about the significance of that development in the U.S.?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s pretty
amazing what&rsquo;s happened, actually. There have been a lot of
cross-cultural studies of what social scientists call &ldquo;religious
fanaticism&rdquo;&mdash;not people who just believe in God or go to
church, but they&rsquo;re really kind of fanatic about it, it&rsquo;s
the kind of fanatic religious commitment that permeates your whole
life. And what these studies demonstrate is that this is a typical
characteristic of pre-industrial societies&mdash;in fact, it
correlates very closely with industrialization: as industrialization
goes up, this kind of religious fanaticism goes down. Well, there are
two countries that are basically off the curve. One of them is
Canada, which has more fundamentalist commitment than you would
expect given its level of industrialization. The other is the United
States&mdash;which is totally off the chart: we&rsquo;re like a
shattered peasant society. I mean, the last study I saw of it was
done in around 1980, and the United States was at the level of
Bangladesh, it was very close to Iran.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">33</font></sup>
Eighty percent of Americans literally believe in religious miracles.
Half the population thinks the world was created a couple thousand
years ago and that fossils were put here to mislead people or
something&mdash;half the population. You just don&rsquo;t find things
like that in other industrial societies. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">34</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, a lot of
political scientists and others have tried to figure out why this
aberration exists. It&rsquo;s one of the many respects in which the
United States is unusual, so you want to see if it&rsquo;s related to
some of the others&mdash;and there <i>are</i> others. For instance,
the United States has an unusually weak labor movement, it has an
unusually narrow political system. Think: there is no other
industrialized Western country that doesn&rsquo;t have a labor-based
political party, and we haven&rsquo;t had one here since the Populist
Party in the 1890s. So we have a very depoliticized population, and
that could be one cause of this phenomenon: if social and political
life don&rsquo;t offer you opportunities to form communities and
associate yourself with things that are meaningful to you, people
look for other ways to do it, and religion&rsquo;s an obvious one.
It&rsquo;s strikingly the case in the black communities, actually,
where the black churches have been the real organizing center which
holds life together: I mean, there&rsquo;s terrible oppression, a lot
of families are falling apart, but the church is there, it brings
people together and they can get together and do things in that
context. And the same is true in many white communities as well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, I don&rsquo;t
think you can draw too many sweeping conclusions from religion
itself&mdash;it&rsquo;s kind of like technology, it depends what you
use it for. Like, even among the fundamentalists, you&rsquo;ve got
Sojourners [a politically progressive religious group], and you have
Jerry Falwell [a right-wing televangelist]. But it certainly does
carry with it the potential of aligning with other  forms of
fanaticism&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a big danger in the United States,
because it&rsquo;s a very significant movement here. In fact, by now
just about every major political figure in the country has to
associate himself with it in some way. In the 1980 election, for
example, all of the three candidates [i.e. Carter, Reagan, and
independent candidate John Anderson] advertised themselves as Born
Again Christians. In the 1984 election, one of the candidates
advertised himself as a Born Again Christian, and the other was a
Methodist minister or something.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">35</font></sup>
In the 1988 election, Dukakis was secular, which is unusual, but Bush
said he was religious.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, Bush,
technically speaking, is not really President&mdash;because he
refused to take the Oath of Office. I don&rsquo;t know how many of
you noticed this, but the wording of the Oath of Office is written in
the Constitution, so you can&rsquo;t fool around with it&mdash;and
Bush refused to read it. The Oath of Office says something about, &ldquo;I
promise to do this, that, and the other thing,&rdquo; and Bush added
the words, &ldquo;so help me God.&rdquo; Well, that&rsquo;s illegal:
he&rsquo;s not President, if anybody cares.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">36</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>ALL: All right!
Yeah!</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Happy? Yeah, let&rsquo;s
impeach him.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t
because Bush is religious&mdash;Bush knows where the nearest church
is . . . because he has to show up there every once in a while. Or
take Reagan: what does it mean to say he was a Born Again Christian?
It means somebody told him he&rsquo;s a Born Again Christian. In
Bush&rsquo;s case, though, I presume he&rsquo;s totally secular, he
just knows that by now you&rsquo;ve got to make a nod to this huge
fundamentalist constituency&mdash;and since you&rsquo;re not going to
offer them anything they really want, you offer them symbolic things,
like saying &ldquo;so help me God&rdquo; or something like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is, if
things ever really come to a crunch in the United States, this
massive part of the population&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s something
like a third of the adult population by now&mdash;could be the basis
for some kind of a fascist movement, readily. For example, if the
country sinks deeply into a recession, a depoliticized population
could very easily be mobilized into thinking it&rsquo;s somebody
else&rsquo;s fault: &ldquo;Why are our lives collapsing? There have
to be bad guys out there doing something for things to be going so
badly&rdquo;&mdash;and the bad guys can be Jews, or homosexuals, or
blacks, or Communists, whatever you pick. If you can whip people into
irrational frenzies like that, they can be extremely dangerous:
that&rsquo;s what 1930s Fascism came from, and something like that
could very easily happen here.</p>

</i>Real<i> </i>Anti-Semitism&rdquo;<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Do you know
about the connections between the Republican Party and the neo-Nazis
which were revealed a few months ago&mdash;and could you talk a bit
about what might be the significance of that in this context?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That was sort of an
interesting phenomenon; it&rsquo;s hard to know exactly how seriously
to take it, but it&rsquo;s certainly very real. I don&rsquo;t know
how many of you followed what happened with the Nazis in the Bush
campaign around last August&mdash;do you know about that stuff?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There&rsquo;s this
part of the Bush campaign called the &ldquo;Ethnic Outreach
Committee,&rdquo; which tries to organize ethnic minorities;
obviously that doesn&rsquo;t mean blacks or Hispanics, it means
Ukrainians, Poles, that sort of business. And it turned out that it
was being run by a bunch of East European Nazis, Ukrainian Nazis,
hysterical anti-Semites, Romanians who came out of the Iron Guard,
and so on. Well, finally this got exposed; some of the people were
reshuffled, some were put into other positions in the Republican
Party&mdash;but it all just passed over very quietly. The Democrats
never even raised the issue during the election campaign. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">37</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You might ask, why?
How come the Democrats never even raised the issue? Well, I think
there was a very good reason for that: I think the Jewish
organizations like the Anti-Defamation League basically called them
off. The point is, these organizations don&rsquo;t ultimately care
about anti-Semitism, what they care about is opposition to the
policies of Israel&mdash;in fact, opposition to their own hawkish
<i>version</i> of the policies of Israel. They&rsquo;re Israeli
government lobbies, essentially, and they understood that these Nazis
in the Bush campaign were quite pro-Israel, so what do they care? The
<i>New Republic,</i> which is sort of an organ for these groups, had
a very interesting editorial on it. It was about anti-Semitism, and
it referred to the fact that this committee was being run by
anti-Semites, Holocaust deniers, Nazis and so on, and then it said:
yes, that&rsquo;s all true, but this is just &ldquo;antique and
anemic&rdquo; anti-Semitism. Nazism is just &ldquo;antique and
anemic&rdquo; anti-Semitism, not terribly important, we shouldn&rsquo;t
get too upset about it. And then it said: the <i>real</i>
anti-Semitism that we ought to be worried about is in the Democratic
Party, which is filled with &ldquo;Jew-haters&rdquo;&mdash;that was
the phrase they used. And part of the proof is, the Democrats were
actually willing to debate a resolution calling for Palestinian
self-determination at their National Convention, so therefore they&rsquo;re
&ldquo;Jew-haters&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;real&rdquo;
anti-Semitism in America. (That was in fact the title of a book by
the Director of the A.D.L., Nathan Perlmutter.)<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">38</font></sup>
Well, the Democrats got the message that they weren&rsquo;t going to
win any points with this, so they never raised a peep about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Incidentally, this
is only one of the things that happened at that time&mdash;there&rsquo;s
another story which got even less publicity, and is even more
revealing. The Department of Education has a program of grants that
it dispenses to fund projects initiated by local school systems, and
for the last four or five years the school board in Brookline,
Massachusetts, has been trying to get funding for a project on the
Holocaust which always gets very favorably reviewed, but is always
turned down. Again in 1988&mdash;also right before the election&mdash;the
federal reviewing committee had to deal with their proposal. As usual
it got very favorable reviews, but instead of just turning it down,
this time the government simply eliminated the entire program
category under which it was being submitted. Well, at that point some
information began to surface as to <i>why</i> the project kept
getting turned down&mdash;and it turned out that it was being refused
every year because of letters the Department was getting from people
like Phyllis Schlafly [a right-wing activist] attacking it for being
unfair because it didn&rsquo;t give adequate space to Nazis and Ku
Klux Klan members. Besides, they said, it&rsquo;s kind of
brainwashing children, and turning them against things like the
Holocaust, it&rsquo;s just more of this neo-liberal tampering with
people&rsquo;s thoughts. Parts of these letters actually got
published in the <i>Washington Post</i> and the <i>Boston Globe.</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">39</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you&rsquo;d
have thought there&rsquo;d be an uproar. A program on the Holocaust
gets turned down by the government, by the Reagan administration,
because it doesn&rsquo;t give enough space to Nazis and Klan members?
Not a peep, not a peep. And the point is, Phyllis Schlafly and that
whole gang are adequately pro-Israel&mdash;and therefore it doesn&rsquo;t
matter what they think. They can be in favor of the Klan, they can be
in favor of the Nazis, they can say you shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to
teach the Holocaust, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, as long as they remain
sufficiently supportive of hawkish Israeli policies. As long as they
meet that qualification, it&rsquo;s fine, they can say whatever they
want.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8550_2032848809"></a>Ronald
Reagan and the Future of Democracy<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: You
mentioned Reagan&mdash;I&rsquo;ve heard you say his administration
was the first time the United States didn&rsquo;t really have a
President. Would you enlarge on that, and tell us what your thoughts
are on the future of that kind of government?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think it has a big
future, myself&mdash;in fact, I think the Reagan administration was
sort of a peek into the future. It&rsquo;s a very natural move.
Imagine yourself working in some public relations office where your
job is to help corporations make sure that the annoying public does
not get in the way of policy-making. Here&rsquo;s a brilliant thought
that nobody ever had before, so far as I know: let&rsquo;s make
elections completely symbolic activities. The population can keep
voting, we&rsquo;ll give them all the business, they&rsquo;ll have
electoral campaigns, all the hoopla, two candidates, eight
candidates&mdash;but the people they&rsquo;re voting for will then
just be expected to read off a teleprompter and they won&rsquo;t be
expected to know anything except what somebody tells them, and maybe
not even that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, when you
read off a teleprompter&mdash;I&rsquo;ve done it actually&mdash;it&rsquo;s
a very odd experience: it&rsquo;s like the words go into your eyes
and out your mouth, and they don&rsquo;t pass through your mind in
between. And when Reagan does it, they have it set up so there are
two or three of them around, so  his head can keep moving and it
appears as though he&rsquo;s looking around at the audience, but
really he&rsquo;s just switching from one teleprompter to another.
Well, if you can get people to vote for something like that, you&rsquo;ve
basically done it&mdash;you&rsquo;ve removed them from
decision-making. It won&rsquo;t work unless you have an obedient
media which will fall over themselves with what a wonderful,
charismatic figure he is&mdash;you know, &ldquo;the most popular
President in history,&rdquo; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s creating a
revolution,&rdquo; &ldquo;the most amazing thing since ice cream,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;how can we criticize him, everybody loves him?&rdquo; And
you have to pretend that nobody&rsquo;s laughing, and so on. But if
you can do that, then you&rsquo;d have gone a very long way towards
marginalizing the public. And I think we probably got there in the
1980s&mdash;pretty close to there, anyway.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In all of the books
that have come out by people in the Reagan administration, it&rsquo;s
been extremely difficult to hide the fact that Reagan didn&rsquo;t
have the foggiest idea what was going on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">40</font></sup>
Whenever he wasn&rsquo;t properly programmed, the things that would
come out of his mouth were kind of like&mdash;they weren&rsquo;t <i>lies</i>
really, they were kind of like the babbling of a child. If a child
babbles, it&rsquo;s not lies, it&rsquo;s just sort of on some other
plane. To be able to <i>lie</i>, you have to have a certain degree of
competence, you have to know what truth is. And there didn&rsquo;t
seem to be any indication that that was the case here. So in fact,
all of the fuss in the Iran-contra hearings about &ldquo;did Reagan
know or didn&rsquo;t he know&rdquo; [about the National Security
Council&rsquo;s illegal dealings with Iran and the Nicaraguan
contras], or &ldquo;did he remember or didn&rsquo;t he remember?&rdquo;
I personally regarded as a cover-up. What&rsquo;s the difference? He
didn&rsquo;t know if nobody told him, and he didn&rsquo;t remember if
he forgot. And who cares? He wasn&rsquo;t supposed to know. Reagan&rsquo;s
whole career was reading lines written for him by rich folk. First it
was as a spokesman for General Electric, then it was for somebody
else, and he just continued to the White House: he read the lines
written for him by the rich folk, he did it for eight years, they
paid him nicely, he apparently enjoyed it, he seems to have been
quite cheerful there, had a good time. He could sleep late. And they
liked it, the paymasters thought it was fine, they bought a nice home
for him, put him out to pasture.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s very
striking how he disappeared. For eight years, the public relations
industry and the media had been claiming that this guy revolutionized
America&mdash;you know, the &ldquo;Reagan Revolution,&rdquo; this
fantastic charismatic figure that everybody loved, he just changed
our lives. Okay, then he finished his job, they told him to go
home&mdash;that&rsquo;s the end. No reporter would even <i>dream</i>
of going out to see Reagan after that to ask him his opinion on
anything&mdash;because everybody knows he <i>has</i> no opinion on
anything. And they knew it all along. In the Oliver North trial, for
example, stuff came out about Reagan telling&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like
to use the word &ldquo;lie,&rdquo; because, as I say, you have to
have a competence to lie&mdash;but Reagan producing false statements
to Congress, let&rsquo;s put it that way. The press didn&rsquo;t even
care: okay, so Reagan lied to Congress, let&rsquo;s go on to the next
thing. The point is, his job  was done, so therefore he became
irrelevant. Sure, they&rsquo;ll trot him out at the next Republican
Convention so everybody can applaud, but that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In a way it was like
royalty. I mean, the imperial family in England plays a real role in
depoliticizing the place, and Reagan reminded me a bit of that.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">41</font></sup>
For instance, every session of Parliament in England opens with the
Queen reading a message written by the ruling political party, and
everybody pretends to take it seriously. But in another part of your
brain, you don&rsquo;t ask, &ldquo;Did the Queen believe what she was
saying?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Did she understand what she was saying?&rdquo;
or &ldquo;Will she remember what she was saying?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Did
she lie to the Parliament?&rdquo; Those are just not relevant
questions&mdash;because the Queen&rsquo;s job is to be royalty, and
to be revered, and to be admired, and to be the model woman that
everybody&rsquo;s supposed to be like. It&rsquo;s kind of like
playing a game in the political system, even though people there do
in fact take it seriously in a sense&mdash;like they <i>care</i> if
the Princess Diana is having a spat with Something-Or-Other, they
think about it, and they talk about it, and so on. But of course, at
some other level of their intelligence, they know that it has nothing
to do with life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the British
have it sort of institutionalized, and you don&rsquo;t vote for
Queen. But suppose you could get to the point where elections in
England were not for Prime Minister and Parliament, but instead
people voted for Queen, and then things ran the way they do now,
except the Prime Minister is just appointed by the banks and the
corporations. And in the election campaign you&rsquo;d ask, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
got the nicest hairdo?&rdquo; you&rsquo;d ask, &ldquo;Who can say
things nicer?&rdquo; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s got the best smile?&rdquo;
Well, then you&rsquo;d have gone a long way towards the desired goal
of maintaining the formal functioning of the system, but eliminating
the substance from it. And that&rsquo;s pretty much what we had with
Reagan, I think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, I don&rsquo;t
know whether Reagan was contrived for that purpose or whether it just
worked out that way, but once having seen it in operation, I expect
that people will learn from it. And in fact, I think you could see
signs of it in the 1988 election as well. I mean, everybody&mdash;the
media and everyone else&mdash;agreed that there were no real issues
in the campaign: the only issue was whether Dukakis was going to
figure out a way of ducking all the slime that was being thrown at
him. That&rsquo;s about the only thing anybody was voting about, did
he duck or didn&rsquo;t he duck? That&rsquo;s like saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
bother voting.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But doesn&rsquo;t
it make any difference who wins? I mean, suppose they gave us Ollie
North as President?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, look, I don&rsquo;t
want to say that it makes <i>no</i> difference. The figure who&rsquo;s
there makes <i>some</i> difference&mdash;but the less difference it
makes, the more you&rsquo;ve marginalized the public.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Do you
vote?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Do <i>I</i>? Well,
differentially. I mean, I almost always vote for lower-level
candidates, like school committee representatives and things like
that&mdash;because there it makes a difference, in fact. But as you
get more and more remote from popular control, it makes less and less
of a difference. When you get to the House of Representatives&mdash;well,
it&rsquo;s sort of academic in my case, because I live in one of
these single-member districts where the same guy always wins, so it
doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether you vote or not. When you get to
Senator, it begins to become pretty symbolic anyway. At the level of
President, half the time I don&rsquo;t even bother&mdash;I think
those are usually very subtle judgments. I mean, it&rsquo;s a
difficult judgment to try to figure out whether Nixon or Humphrey is
going to end the Vietnam War sooner [in 1968], that&rsquo;s an
extremely subtle judgment to make; I actually didn&rsquo;t vote on
that one, because I figured Nixon probably would. I did vote against
Reagan, because I thought the guys <i>around</i> Reagan were
extremely dangerous&mdash;Reagan himself was irrelevant, but the
people in his administration were real killers and torturers, and
they were just making people suffer too much, so I thought that might
make a difference. But these are usually not very easy judgments to
make, in my opinion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: What do
you think stopped the impeachment drive against Reagan after the
Iran-contra scandal?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It would just
embarrass the hell out of everybody&mdash;I mean, nobody in power
wants that much disruption for something like that. Look, why don&rsquo;t
they bring every American President to trial for war crimes? There
are things on which there is a complete consensus in the elite
culture: the United States is <i>permitted</i> to carry out war
crimes, it&rsquo;s <i>permitted</i> to attack other countries, it&rsquo;s
<i>permitted</i> to ignore international law. On those things there&rsquo;s
a complete consensus, so why should they impeach the President for
doing everything he&rsquo;s supposed to do?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, you can ask
all kinds of questions like that. For instance, at the time of the
Nuremberg trials [of Nazi war criminals after World War II], there
was a lot of very pompous rhetoric on the part of the Western
prosecutors about how this was not just going to be &ldquo;victor&rsquo;s
justice&rdquo;: it&rsquo;s not just that we won the war and they
lost, we&rsquo;re establishing principles which are going to apply to
<i>us</i> too. Well, by the principles of the Nuremberg trials, every
single American President since then would have been hanged. Has
anyone ever been brought to trial? Has this point even been raised?
It&rsquo;s not a difficult point to demonstrate.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">42</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, the
Nuremberg trials are worth thinking about. The Nazis were something
unique, granted. But if you take a look at the Nuremberg trials, they
were very cynical. The operational criterion for what counted as a
war crime at Nuremberg was <i>a criminal act that the West didn&rsquo;t
do</i>: in other words, it was considered a legitimate defense if you
could show that the Americans and the British did the same thing.
That&rsquo;s actually true. So  part of the defense of the German
submarine commander Admiral Doenitz was to call an American submarine
commander, Admiral Nimitz, to testify that the Americans did the same
thing&mdash;that&rsquo;s a defense. Bombing of urban areas was not
considered a war crime at Nuremberg; reason is, the West did more of
it than the Germans. And this is all stated straight out&mdash;like
if you read the book by Telford Taylor, the American prosecutor at
the trials, this is the way he describes it; he&rsquo;s very positive
about the whole thing.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">43</font></sup>
If the West had done it, it wasn&rsquo;t a crime; it was only a crime
if the Germans had done it and we hadn&rsquo;t. I mean, it&rsquo;s
true there were plenty of such things, but still there&rsquo;s
something pretty cynical about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, even worse
than the Nuremberg trials were the Tokyo trials [of Japanese war
criminals]: by the standards of the Tokyo trials, not just every
American President, but <i>everyone</i> would be hanged [at Tokyo,
those who failed to take affirmative steps to prevent war crimes or
to dissociate themselves from the government were executed]. General
Yamashita was an extreme case: he was hanged because during the
American conquest of the Philippines, troops that were technically
under his command, although he had already lost all contact with
them, carried out crimes&mdash;therefore <i>he</i> was hanged. Ask
yourself who&rsquo;s going to survive that one. Here&rsquo;s a guy
who was hanged because troops he had no contact with whatsoever, but
which theoretically in some order of battle had to do with his units,
committed atrocities. If those same principles apply to us, who&rsquo;s
going to survive? And that was just one case, I think we killed about
a thousand people in the Tokyo trials&mdash;they were really
grotesque.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">44</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Just going
back to elections for a second&mdash;would you say the &rsquo;84
elections were the same as &rsquo;88: no substance?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, in the 1984
elections there was still an issue. In the 1984 elections, the
Republicans were the party of Keynesian growth [the economist Keynes
advocated government stimulation of the economy]&mdash;they said,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just keep spending and spending and spending,
bigger and bigger deficits, and somehow that will lead to
growth&rdquo;&mdash;whereas the Democrats were the party of fiscal
conservatism: they had this sad-looking son of a minister [Mondale]
saying, &ldquo;No, no good; we can&rsquo;t keep spending, we&rsquo;re
going to get in trouble, we&rsquo;ve got to watch the money supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, for anybody
who gets amused at these things, the Republicans and the Democrats
had shifted their traditional positions 180 degrees; historically,
the <i>Democrats</i> have been the party of Keynesian growth, and the
<i>Republicans</i> have been the party of fiscal conservatism. But
they shifted totally&mdash;and what&rsquo;s interesting is, nobody
even noticed this, I never even saw a single comment on it in the
press. Well, that tells you something: what it tells you is, there
are different sectors of the business community in the country, and
they sometimes have slightly different tactical judgments about the
way to deal with current problems. And when they differ on
something, it&rsquo;ll come up in the election; when they don&rsquo;t
differ on anything, there won&rsquo;t be any issues.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8552_2032848809"></a>Two
New Factors in World Affairs<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: To move to a
more general level, Professor&mdash;I&rsquo;m interested whether you
think that there are any developments over the past few decades that
are new on the international scene, which people should be aware of
as we analyze things that are taking place in the world?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, in my view,
there are at least two really major things that are coming along that
are new: one is a shift in the international economy.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">45</font></sup>
And the other is the threat to the environment&mdash;which just can&rsquo;t
be ignored much longer, because if facing it is delayed too much
longer there isn&rsquo;t going to be a lot more to human history.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I&rsquo;ll start
with the environment. The reality is that under capitalist
conditions&mdash;meaning maximization of short-term gain&mdash;you&rsquo;re
ultimately going to destroy the environment: the only question is
when. Now, for a long time, it&rsquo;s been possible to pretend that
the environment is an infinite source and an infinite sink. Neither
is true obviously, and we&rsquo;re now sort of approaching the point
where you can&rsquo;t keep playing the game too much longer. It may
not be very far off. Well, dealing with that problem is going to
require large-scale social changes of an almost unimaginable kind.
For one thing, it&rsquo;s going to certainly require large-scale
social planning, and that means participatory social planning if it&rsquo;s
going to be at all meaningful. It&rsquo;s also going to require a
general recognition among human beings that an economic system driven
by greed is going to self-destruct&mdash;it&rsquo;s only a question
of time before you make the planet unlivable, by destroying the ozone
layer or some other way.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">46</font></sup>
And that means huge socio-psychological changes have to take place if
the human species is going to survive very much longer. So that&rsquo;s
a big factor.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Quite apart from
that, there have been major changes in the international economy. The
world has basically been moving into three major economic blocks; the
United States is no longer the sole economic power like it was after
World War II. There&rsquo;s a Japan-based system, which involves
Japan and the countries around its periphery, like Singapore and
Taiwan, the old Japanese empire. There&rsquo;s Europe, which has been
consolidating into the European Common Market&mdash;and that could be
a powerful economic unit; if Europe gets its act together, it&rsquo;ll
outweigh the United States: it&rsquo;s got a larger economy, a bigger
population, a more educated population, and they&rsquo;ve got their
traditional colonial interests, which are in fact being
reconstructed. Meanwhile the United States has been building up its
own counter-block in North America through so-called &ldquo;free
trade&rdquo; agreements, which are turning Canada into kind of an
economic colony and basically  absorbing Northern Mexico into the
United States as a cheap-labor area. The three regions are roughly
comparable by most measures, with the Asian region still far ahead in
capital reserves.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No one understands
quite how this situation will be affected by the financial
liberalization that has been so harmful to the global economy since
the mid-1970s. And there are also other intriguing issues. For
example, the European powers, especially Germany, are attempting to
reconstruct the traditional colonial relations between Central Europe
and Eastern Europe that existed before the Cold War&mdash;Central
Europe has the industry and technology and investment capital, and
Eastern Europe and Russia provide them with cheap manpower and
resources. Meanwhile Japan is doing precisely the same thing with
Russia on the Asian side, trying to construct colonial relations with
Siberia: Japan has plenty of extra capital, and Siberia has plenty of
resources that the Russians can&rsquo;t exploit properly because they
don&rsquo;t have the capital or the technology, so it&rsquo;s like a
natural combination. And if these efforts work, then we&rsquo;re
going to have the two major enemies of the United States, Japan and
Europe, integrating with the Soviet Union, it becoming kind of a
semi-colonial area related to them. And that realizes the worst
nightmares of American planners.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, there is an
American geopolitical tradition which treats the United States as an
island power off the mainland of Europe; it&rsquo;s a bigger version
of British geopolitics, which treats England as an island power off
the mainland of Europe. I mean, Britain throughout its whole modern
history has tried to prevent Europe from becoming unified&mdash;that
was the main theme of British history, prevent Europe from being
unified, because we&rsquo;re just this island power off of Europe,
and if they ever get unified we&rsquo;re in trouble. And the United
States has the same attitude towards Eurasia: we&rsquo;ve got to
prevent them from becoming unified, because if they are, we become a
real second-class power&mdash;we&rsquo;ll still have our little
system around here, but it&rsquo;ll become kind of second-class. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">47</font></sup>
By &ldquo;the United States,&rdquo; I mean powerful interests in the
United States, U.S.-based capital.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Then do
you think it&rsquo;s possible that the U.S. may not be considered a
superpower someday?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you know,
despite the <i>relative</i> decline in U.S.-based power, it&rsquo;s
still powerful without historical precedent.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: I know it
is militarily.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, even
economically. Look, it&rsquo;s a real scandal of the American
economic system that the general economic level here is so low. I
mean, by world standards, in terms of, say, infant mortality or
lifespan, or most other measures like that, people are not terribly
well-off here&mdash;the United States is well down the list. I think
we&rsquo;re twentieth of twenty industrial powers in  infant
mortality, for example. We&rsquo;re at about the level of Cuba, which
is a poor Third World country, in terms of health standards.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">48</font></sup>
Those are absolute scandals&mdash;the general population of the
United States ought to be better off than that of any other country
in the world by just a huge margin. No other industrial power has
anything like our resources. We&rsquo;ve got an educated population,
like basic literacy is relatively high. We have a comparatively
uniform population: people speak English all over the place&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t find that in too many areas of the world. We&rsquo;ve got
enormous military power. We have no enemies anywhere nearby. Very few
powers in history have ever had that situation. So these are just
incomparable advantages, and our economic system has not turned them
to the benefit of the population here, particularly&mdash;but they&rsquo;re
there, and they&rsquo;re going to stay there.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now take Japan:
Japanese corporations and investors can collect a lot of capital, but
they&rsquo;re never going to get their own resources&mdash;they don&rsquo;t
have their own energy resources, they don&rsquo;t have their own raw
materials, they don&rsquo;t have agricultural resources. And we do:
that makes a big difference. In fact, American planners back in the
late 1940s were very well aware of this difference when they sort of
organized the post-war world&mdash;so while they helped Japan to
reindustrialize, they also insisted on controlling its energy
resources: the Japanese were not allowed to develop their own
petrochemical industry, or to obtain their own independent access to
petroleum resources. And the reason for that is explained in
now-declassified U.S. internal documents: as George Kennan [State
Department official and diplomat], who was one of the major planners
of the post-war world, pointed out, if we control Japan&rsquo;s
energy resources, we will have veto power over Japan&mdash;if they
ever get out of line, we&rsquo;ll just choke off their energy
supply.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">49</font></sup>
Now, whether or not that plan would still work you don&rsquo;t know,
because the world is changing in unpredictable ways. But for the
moment, the United States is still overwhelmingly powerful in world
affairs&mdash;that&rsquo;s why we can get away with so much.</p>

Under Capitalism<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You
mentioned that we&rsquo;re going to need participatory social
planning to save the environment. I&rsquo;m wondering, doesn&rsquo;t
decentralization of power also somehow conflict with trying to save
the environment&mdash;I mean, that can&rsquo;t be done without some
sort of central agreement, don&rsquo;t you think?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, first of all,
<i>agreements</i> don&rsquo;t require centralized authority, certain
<i>kinds</i> of agreements do. One&rsquo;s assumption, at least, is
that decentralization of power will lead to decisions that reflect
the interests of the entire population. The idea is that policies
flowing from any kind of decision-making apparatus are going to tend
to reflect the interests of the people involved in making the
decisions&mdash;which certainly seems plausible. So if a decision is
made by some centralized authority, it is going to represent the
interests of the particular group which is in power. But if power is
actually rooted in large parts of the population&mdash;if people can
actually participate in social planning&mdash;then they will
presumably do so in terms of their own interests, and you can expect
the decisions to reflect those interests. Well, the interest of the
general population is to preserve human life; the interest of
corporations is to make profits&mdash;those are fundamentally
different interests.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: In an
industrial society, though, one might argue that people need to have
jobs.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sure, but having
jobs doesn&rsquo;t require destroying the environment which makes
life possible. I mean, if you have participatory social planning, and
people are trying to work things out in terms of their own interests,
they are going to want to balance opportunities to work with quality
of work, with type of energy available, with conditions of personal
interaction, with the need to make sure your children survive, and so
on and so forth. But those are all considerations that simply don&rsquo;t
<i>arise</i> for corporate executives, they just are not a part of
the agenda. In fact, if the C.E.O. of General Electric started making
decisions on <i>that</i> basis, he&rsquo;d be thrown out of his job
in three seconds, or maybe there&rsquo;d be a corporate takeover or
something&mdash;because those things are not a part of his job. His
job is to raise profit and market share, not to make sure that the
environment survives, or that his workers lead decent lives. And
those goals are simply in conflict.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Give us an
example of what exactly you mean by social planning.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, right now we
have to make big decisions about how to produce energy, for one
thing&mdash;because if we continue to produce energy by combustion,
the human race isn&rsquo;t going to survive very much longer.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">50</font></sup>
Alright, that decision requires social planning: it&rsquo;s not
something that you can just decide on yourself. Like, you can decide
to put a solar-energy something-or-other on your own house, but that
doesn&rsquo;t really help. This is the kind of decision where it only
works if it&rsquo;s done on a mass scale.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I thought
you might have been referring to population control.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, population
control is another issue where it doesn&rsquo;t matter if <i>you</i>
do it, everybody has to do it. It&rsquo;s like traffic: I mean, you
can&rsquo;t make driving a car survivable by driving well yourself;
there has to be kind of a social contract involved, otherwise it
won&rsquo;t work. Like, if there was no social contract involved in
driving&mdash;everybody was just driving like a lethal weapon, going
as fast as they can and forgetting all the traffic lights and
everything else&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t make that situation safe
just by driving well yourself: it doesn&rsquo;t make much difference
if you set out to drive safely if everybody else  is driving
lethal-weapon, right? The trouble is, that&rsquo;s the way that
capitalism works. The nature of the system is that it&rsquo;s
supposed to be driven by greed; no one&rsquo;s supposed to be
concerned for anybody else, nobody&rsquo;s supposed to worry about
the common good&mdash;those are not things that are supposed to
motivate you, that&rsquo;s the principle of the system. The theory is
that private vices lead to public benefits&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
they teach you in economics departments. It&rsquo;s all total
bullshit, of course, but that&rsquo;s what they teach you. And as
long as the system works that way, yeah, it&rsquo;s going to
self-destruct.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What&rsquo;s more,
capitalists have long understood this. So most government regulatory
systems have in fact been strongly lobbied for by the industries
themselves: industries want to be regulated, because they know that
if they&rsquo;re not, they&rsquo;re going to destroy themselves in
the unbridled competition. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">51</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Then what
kind of mechanism for social planning do you think would work?
Obviously you&rsquo;re not too sanguine about our current form of
government.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there&rsquo;s
nothing wrong with the <i>form</i>&mdash;I mean, there are <i>some</i>
things wrong with the form&mdash;but what&rsquo;s really wrong is
that the <i>substance</i> is missing. Look, as long as you have
private control over the economy, it doesn&rsquo;t make any
difference what forms you have, because they can&rsquo;t do anything.
You could have political parties where everybody gets together and
participates, and <i>you</i> make the programs, make things as
participatory as you like&mdash;and it would still have only the most
marginal effect on policy. And the reason is, power lies elsewhere.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So suppose all of us
here convinced everybody in the country to vote for us for President,
we got 98 percent of the vote and both Houses of Congress, and then
we started to institute very badly needed social reforms that most of
the population wants. Simply ask yourself, what would happen? Well,
if your imagination doesn&rsquo;t tell you, take a look at real
cases. There are places in the world that have a broader range of
political parties than we do, like Latin American countries, for
example, which in this respect are much more democratic than we are.
Well, when popular reform candidates in Latin America get elected and
begin to introduce reforms, two things typically happen. One is,
there&rsquo;s a military coup supported by the United States. But
suppose that doesn&rsquo;t happen. What you get is capital
strike&mdash;investment capital flows out of the country, there&rsquo;s
a lowering of investment, and the economy grinds to a halt.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s the
problem that Nicaragua has faced in the 1980s&mdash;and which it
cannot overcome, in my view, it&rsquo;s just a hopeless problem. See,
the Sandinistas have tried to run a mixed economy: they&rsquo;ve
tried to carry out social programs to benefit the population, but
they&rsquo;ve also had to appeal to the business community to prevent
capital flight from destroying the place. So  most public funds, to
the extent there are any, go as a bribe to the wealthy, to try to
keep them investing in the country. The only problem is, the wealthy
would prefer <i>not</i> to invest unless they have political power:
they&rsquo;d rather see the society destroyed. So the wealthy take
the bribes, and they send them to Swiss banks and to Miami
banks&mdash;because from their perspective, the Sandinista government
just has the wrong priorities. I mean, these guys hate democracy just
as much as Congress hates democracy: they want the political system
to be in the hands of wealthy elites, and when it is again, then
they&rsquo;ll call it &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; and they&rsquo;ll
resume investing, and the economy will finally start to function
again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the same thing
would happen here if we ever had a popular reform candidate who
actually achieved some formal level of power: there would be
disinvestment, capital strike, a grinding down of the economy. And
the reason is quite simple. In our society, real power does not
happen to lie in the political system, it lies in the private
economy: that&rsquo;s where the decisions are made about what&rsquo;s
produced, how much is produced, what&rsquo;s consumed, where
investment takes place, who has jobs, who controls the resources, and
so on and so forth. And as long as that remains the case, changes
inside the political system can make <i>some</i> difference&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t want to say it&rsquo;s zero&mdash;but the differences are
going to be very slight.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, if you
think through the logic of this, you&rsquo;ll see that so long as
power remains privately concentrated, everybody, <i>everybody</i>,
has to be committed to one overriding goal: and that&rsquo;s to make
sure that the rich folk are happy&mdash;because unless they are,
nobody else is going to get anything. So if you&rsquo;re a homeless
person sleeping in the streets of Manhattan, let&rsquo;s say, your
first concern must be that the guys in the mansions are happy&mdash;because
if they&rsquo;re happy, then they&rsquo;ll invest, and the economy
will work, and things will function, and then maybe something will
trickle down to you somewhere along the line. But if they&rsquo;re
<i>not</i> happy, everything&rsquo;s going to grind to a halt, and
you&rsquo;re not even going to get anything trickling down. So if
you&rsquo;re a homeless person in the streets, your first concern is
the happiness of the wealthy guys in the mansions and the fancy
restaurants. Basically that&rsquo;s a metaphor for the whole society.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Like, suppose
Massachusetts were to increase business taxes. Most of the population
is in favor of it, but you can predict what would happen. Business
would run a public relations campaign&mdash;which is true, in fact,
it&rsquo;s not lies&mdash;saying, &ldquo;You raise taxes on business,
you soak the rich, and you&rsquo;ll find that capital is going to
flow elsewhere, and you&rsquo;re not going to have any jobs, you&rsquo;re
not going to have anything.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not the way they&rsquo;d
put it exactly, but that&rsquo;s what it would amount to: &ldquo;Unless
you make us happy you&rsquo;re not going to have anything, because we
own the place; you live here, but we own the place.&rdquo; And in
fact, that&rsquo;s basically the message that <i>is</i> presented,
not in those words of course, whenever a reform measure does come
along somewhere&mdash;they have a big propaganda campaign saying,
it&rsquo;s going to hurt jobs, it&rsquo;s going to hurt investment,
there&rsquo;s going to be a loss of  business confidence, and so on.
That&rsquo;s just a complicated way of saying, unless you keep
business happy, the population isn&rsquo;t going to have anything.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What do you
think about nationalization of industry as a means of allowing for
this kind of large-scale social planning?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it would
depend on how it&rsquo;s done. If nationalization of industry puts
production into the hands of a state bureaucracy or some sort of
Leninist-style vanguard party, then you&rsquo;d just have another
system of exploitation, in my view. On the other hand, if
nationalization of industry was based on actual popular control over
industry&mdash;workers&rsquo; control over factories, community
control, with the groups maybe federated together and so on&mdash;then
that would be a different story. That would be a <i>very</i>
different story, in fact. That would be extending the democratic
system to economic power, and unless that happens, political power is
always going to remain a very limited phenomenon.</p>

Empire<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Then is
the basic goal of the United States when it intervenes in Third World
countries to destroy left-wing governments in order to keep them from
power?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, the primary
concern is to prevent <i>independence</i>, regardless of the
ideology. Remember, we&rsquo;re the global power, so we have to make
sure that all the various parts of the world continue serving their
assigned functions in our global system. And the assigned functions
of Third World countries are to be markets for American business,
sources of resources for American business, to provide cheap labor
for American business, and so on. I mean, there&rsquo;s no big secret
about that&mdash;the media won&rsquo;t tell you and scholarship won&rsquo;t
tell you, but all you have to do is look at declassified government
documents and this is all explained very frankly and explicitly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The internal
documentary record in the United States goes way back, and it says
the same thing over and over again. Here&rsquo;s virtually a quote:
the main commitment of the United States, internationally in the
Third World, must be to prevent the rise of nationalist regimes which
are responsive to pressures from the masses of the population for
improvement in low living standards and diversification of
production; the reason is, we have to maintain a climate that is
conducive to investment, and to ensure conditions which allow for
adequate repatriation of profits to the West. Language like that is
repeated year after year in top-level U.S. planning documents, like
National Security Council reports on Latin America and so on&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s exactly what we do around the world.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">52</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the nationalism
we oppose doesn&rsquo;t need to be <i>left-wing</i>&mdash;we&rsquo;re
just as  much opposed to <i>right-wing</i> nationalism. I mean, when
there&rsquo;s a right-wing military coup which seeks to turn some
Third World country on a course of independent development, the
United States will also try to destroy that government&mdash;we
opposed Per&oacute;n in Argentina, for example.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">53</font></sup>
So despite what you always hear, U.S. interventionism has nothing to
do with resisting the spread of &ldquo;Communism,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s
<i>independence</i> we&rsquo;ve always been opposed to everywhere&mdash;and
for quite a good reason. If a country begins to pay attention to its
own population, it&rsquo;s not going to be paying adequate attention
to the overriding needs of U.S. investors. Well, those are
unacceptable priorities, so that government&rsquo;s just going to
have to go.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the effects of
this commitment throughout the Third World are dramatically clear: it
takes only a moment&rsquo;s thought to realize that the areas that
have been the most under U.S. control are some of the most horrible
regions in the world. For instance, why is Central America such a
horror-chamber? I mean, if a peasant in Guatemala woke up in Poland
[i.e. under Soviet occupation], he&rsquo;d think he was in heaven by
comparison&mdash;and Guatemala&rsquo;s an area where we&rsquo;ve had
a hundred years of influence. Well, that tells you something. Or look
at Brazil: potentially an extremely rich country with tremendous
resources, except it had the curse of being part of the Western
system of subordination. So in northeast Brazil, for example, which
is a rather fertile area with plenty of rich land, just it&rsquo;s
all owned by plantations, Brazilian medical researchers now identify
the population as a new species with about 40 percent the brain size
of human beings, a result of generations of profound malnutrition and
neglect&mdash;and this may be un-remediable except after generations,
because of the lingering effects of malnutrition on one&rsquo;s
offspring.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">54</font></sup>
Alright, that&rsquo;s a good example of the legacy of our
commitments, and the same kind of pattern runs throughout the former
Western colonies.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, if you look
at the countries that have developed in the world, there&rsquo;s a
little simple fact which should be obvious to anyone on five minutes&rsquo;
observation, but which you never find anyone saying in the United
States: the countries that have developed economically are those
which were not colonized by the West; every country that was
colonized by the West is a total wreck. I mean, Japan was the one
country that managed to resist European colonization, and it&rsquo;s
the one part of the traditional Third World that developed. Okay,
Europe conquered everything except Japan, and Japan developed. What
does that tell you? Historians of Africa have actually pointed out
that if you look at Japan when it began its industrialization process
[in the 1870s], it was at about the same developmental level as the
Asante kingdom in West Africa in terms of resources available, level
of state formation, degree of technological development, and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">55</font></sup>
Well, just compare those two areas today. It&rsquo;s true there were
a number of differences between them historically, but the crucial
one is that Japan wasn&rsquo;t conquered by the West and the Asante
kingdom was, by the British&mdash;so now West Africa is West Africa
economically, and Japan is Japan.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Japan had its own
colonial system too, incidentally&mdash;but its colonies developed,
and they developed because Japan didn&rsquo;t treat them the way the
Western powers treated their colonies. The Japanese were very brutal
colonizers, they weren&rsquo;t nice guys, but they nonetheless
developed their colonies economically; the West just robbed theirs.
So if you look at the growth rate of Taiwan and Korea during the
period of Japanese colonization, it was approximately the same as
Japan&rsquo;s own growth rate through the early part of this
century&mdash;they were getting industrialized, developing
infrastructure, educational levels were going up, agricultural
production was increasing. In fact, by the 1930s, Formosa (now
Taiwan) was one of the commercial centers of Asia.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">56</font></sup>
Well, just compare Taiwan with the Philippines, an American colony
right next door: the Philippines is a total basket-case, a Latin
American-style basket-case. Again, that tells you something.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">With World War II,
the Japanese colonial system got smashed up. But by the 1960s, Korea
and Taiwan were again developing at their former growth rate&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s because in the post-war period, they&rsquo;ve been able
to follow the Japanese model of development: they&rsquo;re pretty
closed off to foreign exploitation, quite egalitarian by
international standards, they devote pretty extensive resources to
things like education and health care. Okay, that&rsquo;s a
successful model for development. I mean, these Asian countries
aren&rsquo;t pretty; I can&rsquo;t stand them myself&mdash;they&rsquo;re
extremely authoritarian, the role of women you can&rsquo;t even talk
about, and so on, so there are plenty of unpleasant things about
them. But they have been able to pursue economic development measures
that are successful: the state coordinates industrial policy, capital
export is strictly constrained, import levels are kept low. Well,
those are exactly the kinds of policies that are <i>impossible</i> in
Latin America, because the U.S. insists that those governments keep
their economies <i>open</i> to international markets&mdash;so capital
from Latin America is constantly flowing to the West. Alright, that&rsquo;s
not a problem in South Korea: they have the death penalty for capital
export. Solves that difficulty pretty fast.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">57</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is,
the Japanese-style development model works&mdash;in fact, it&rsquo;s
how every country in the world that&rsquo;s developed has done it: by
imposing high levels of protectionism, and by extricating its economy
from free-market discipline. And that&rsquo;s precisely what the
Western powers have been preventing the rest of the Third World from
doing, right up to this moment.</p>

the situation is kind of like what one concludes from looking at the
very likely potential of ecological catastrophe: either control over
these matters is left in the hands of existing power interests and
the rest of the population just abdicates, goes to the beach and
hopes that somehow their children will survive&mdash;or else people
will become sufficiently organized  to break down the entire system
of exploitation, and finally start putting it under participatory
control. One possibility will mean complete disaster; the other, you
can imagine all kinds of things. For example, even profitability
would no longer be all that important&mdash;what would be important
is living in a decent way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, the general
population here does not gain very much from holding on to our
imperial system&mdash;in fact, it may gain nothing from it. If you
take a look at imperial systems over history, it&rsquo;s not at all
clear that they are profitable enterprises in the final analysis.
This has been studied in the case of the British Empire, and while
you only get kind of qualitative answers, it looks as if the British
Empire may have cost as much to maintain as the profits that came
from it. And probably something like that is true for the
U.S.-dominated system too. So take Central America: there are profits
from our controlling Central America, but it&rsquo;s very doubtful
that they come anywhere near the probably ten billion dollars a year
in tax money that&rsquo;s required to maintain U.S. domination
there.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">58</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Those
costs are paid by the people, though, while the profits are made by
the rich.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s it
exactly&mdash;if you ask, &ldquo;Why have an empire?&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve
just given the answer. The empire is like every other part of social
policy: it&rsquo;s a way for the poor to pay off the rich in their
own society. So if the empire is just another form of social policy
by which the poor are subsidizing the rich, that means that under
democratic social planning, there would be very little incentive for
it&mdash;let alone the obvious moral considerations that would become
a factor at that point. In fact, all kinds of questions would just
change, radically.</p>

and the Future<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Mr. Chomsky,
you present a very powerful view of the problems of capitalism, which
I totally accept. When you start talking about the dissidence of the
American population and the possibilities for large-scale change,
though, I&rsquo;ve got to admit that I have a little bit of trouble.
I don&rsquo;t see the same general disillusionment with the system
that you describe. I think people maybe see things that are wrong in
certain areas, maybe see that they&rsquo;re powerless, but on the
whole still really seem to buy into it&mdash;they think Reagan was a
hands-off guy, not a figurehead created by the public relations
industry.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, people aren&rsquo;t
out in the streets revolting, that&rsquo;s true&mdash;you can just
look outside the door and see that. But by any index I know, the fact
of the matter is that the public has become dramatically more
dissident and skeptical.  So for example, about half the population
thinks that the government is just run by &ldquo;a few big interests
looking out for themselves.&rdquo;<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">59</font></sup>
As to whether Reagan was a hands-off guy or a figurehead, frankly
that doesn&rsquo;t matter very much. The reality is that people
either know or can quickly be convinced that <i>they</i> are not
involved in policy-making, that policy is being made by powerful
interests which don&rsquo;t have much to do with them. Now, I think
they sometimes misidentify the powerful interests&mdash;for instance,
they include labor unions as among them; well, that&rsquo;s
propaganda. But when they mention corporations, big media, banks,
investment firms, law firms that cater to their interests, things
like that, okay, then I think they&rsquo;re on target.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, yeah, people
aren&rsquo;t out revolting in the streets, that&rsquo;s for sure. But
I think there&rsquo;s plenty of potential. I mean, the environmental
movement is big, and remember, it&rsquo;s a movement of the
Seventies, not the Sixties. The Third World solidarity movements are
movements of the Eighties. The anti-nuclear movement is a movement of
the Eighties. The feminist movement is Seventies and Eighties. And
it&rsquo;s way beyond movements&mdash;there are all kinds of people
who are just cynical: they don&rsquo;t have any faith in
institutions, they don&rsquo;t trust anybody, they hate the
government, they assume they&rsquo;re being manipulated and
controlled and that something&rsquo;s going on which they don&rsquo;t
know about. Now, that&rsquo;s not necessarily a move to the <i>left</i>:
that could be the basis for fascism too&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a
question of what people do with it. I mean, this kind of
depoliticized, cynical population could easily be mobilized by Jimmy
Swaggart [a televangelist], or it could be organized by
environmentalists. Mostly it just depends on who&rsquo;s willing to
do the work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: But do you
actually believe that these positive changes will come?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I don&rsquo;t know,
I really haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea. But nobody could ever have
predicted any revolutionary struggle&mdash;they&rsquo;re just not
predictable. I mean, you couldn&rsquo;t have predicted in 1775 that
there was going to be an American Revolution, it would have been
impossible to have predicted it. But there was. You couldn&rsquo;t
have predicted in 1954 that there was going to be a Civil Rights
Movement. You couldn&rsquo;t have predicted in 1987 that there was
going to be an uprising on the West Bank. I don&rsquo;t think at any
stage in history it has ever been possible to decide whether to be
optimistic or pessimistic, you just don&rsquo;t know&mdash;nobody
understands how change happens, so how can you guess?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Let me just take a
concrete case. In 1968, M.I.T. [the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology] was the deadest place in the world&mdash;there was no
anti-war activity, nothing was going on. And this was <i>after</i>
the Tet Offensive: Wall Street had turned against the war, M.I.T.
still hadn&rsquo;t heard about it. Well, a small group of students
who were in a little collective on campus  decided they would set up
a sanctuary for a soldier who deserted; that was the kind of thing
activists were doing back then. There was this working-class Marine
kid who wanted to desert as an anti-war gesture, so the idea was,
people would stay with him until the cops came, then they&rsquo;d try
to make a public issue out of it. There was a discussion about this
among ten or fifteen students and two or three faculty members&mdash;and
I came out against it, because I was totally pessimistic; I thought
it couldn&rsquo;t possibly work, I thought that it would be a
complete fiasco. But they went ahead with it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it turned out
to be an <i>incredible</i> success. I mean, within about two days,
the whole of M.I.T. was totally shut down&mdash;there weren&rsquo;t
any classes, nothing was going on, the whole student body was over in
the Student Center. It turned into a 24-hour mixture of seminars, and
you know, this horrible music that people listen to, all that kind of
stuff&mdash;it was very exciting. And it just changed the whole
character of the place; ever since then, M.I.T. has not been the
same. I mean, it&rsquo;s not that it turned into Utopia or anything,
but a lot of concern developed and a lot of activity started up,
which still continues, on issues which people didn&rsquo;t even
consider before. Well, could you have guessed? I mean, I guessed
wrong, they guessed right. But as far as I can see, it was basically
like flipping a coin.</p>

Military-Industrial Complex<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: What&rsquo;s
been the point of the arms race, Dr. Chomsky?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there are a
lot of things, it&rsquo;s served a number of crucial functions.
Remember, any state, <i>any</i> state, has a primary enemy: its own
population. If politics begins to break out inside your own country
and the population starts getting active, all kinds of horrible
things can happen&mdash;so you have to keep the population quiescent
and obedient and passive. And international conflict is one of the
best ways of doing it: if there&rsquo;s a big enemy around, people
will abandon their rights, because you&rsquo;ve got to survive. So
the arms race is functional in that respect&mdash;it creates global
tension and a mood of fear.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s also
functional for controlling the empire: if we want to invade South
Vietnam, let&rsquo;s say, we have to be able to make it look as if
we&rsquo;re defending ourselves from the Russians. If we&rsquo;re not
able to do that, it&rsquo;s going to be a lot harder to invade South
Vietnam. The domestic population just won&rsquo;t accept it&mdash;it&rsquo;s
costly, it&rsquo;s morally costly if nothing else, to do these
things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The arms race also
plays a crucial role in keeping the economy going&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
a big problem. Suppose that the arms race really did decline: how
would you force the taxpayers to keep subsidizing high-technology
industry like they&rsquo;ve been doing for the past fifty years? Is
some politician going to get up and say, &ldquo;Alright, next year
you&rsquo;re going to lower your standard of living, because you have
to subsidize I.B.M. so that it can produce fifth-generation
computers&rdquo;? Nobody&rsquo;s going to be able to sell that line.
If any politician ever started talking that way, people would say:
&ldquo;Okay, we want to start getting involved in social and economic
policy-making too.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, that danger
has been very openly discussed in the business literature  in the
United States for forty or fifty years.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">1</font></sup>
Business leaders know perfectly well what every economist knows: that
spending for civilian purposes is maybe even <i>more</i> efficient,
<i>more</i> profitable than spending for military purposes. And they
also know that there are any number of ways to have the population
subsidize high-technology industry besides through the Pentagon
system&mdash;business knows that perfectly well, and it also knows
the reasons against it. They remain what they always were.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you take an
economics course, they&rsquo;ll teach you, correctly, that if the
government spends <i>n</i> dollars to stimulate the economy, it
doesn&rsquo;t really matter what it&rsquo;s spent on: they can build
jet planes, they can bury it in the sand and get people to dig for
it, they can build roads and houses, they can do all sorts of
things&mdash;in terms of stimulating the economy, the economic
effects are not all that different.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">2</font></sup>
In fact, it&rsquo;s perfectly likely that military spending is
actually a <i>less</i> efficient stimulus than social spending, for
all kinds of reasons. But the problem is, spending for civilian
purposes has negative side effects. For one thing, it interferes with
managerial prerogatives. The money that&rsquo;s funneled through the
Pentagon system is just a straight gift to the corporate manager,
it&rsquo;s like saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll buy anything you produce,
and I&rsquo;ll pay for the research and development, and if you can
make any profits, fine.&rdquo; From the point of view of the
corporate manager, that&rsquo;s optimal. But if the government
started producing anything that business might be able to sell
directly to the commercial market, then it would be interfering with
corporate profit-making. Production of waste&mdash;of expensive,
useless machinery&mdash;is not an interference: nobody else is going
to produce B-2 bombers, right? So that&rsquo;s one point.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The other point,
which is probably even more serious from the perspective of private
power, is that social spending increases the danger of democracy&mdash;it
threatens to increase popular involvement in decision-making. For
example, if the government gets involved, say around here, in
building hospitals and schools and roads and things like that, people
are going to get interested in it, and they&rsquo;ll want to have a
say in it&mdash;because it affects them, and is related to their
lives. On the other hand, if the government says, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to build a Stealth Bomber,&rdquo; nobody has any opinions.
People <i>care</i> about where there&rsquo;s going to be a school or
a hospital, but they don&rsquo;t care about what kind of jet plane
you build&mdash;because they don&rsquo;t have the foggiest idea about
that. And since one of the main purposes of social policy is to keep
the population passive, people with power are going to want to
eliminate anything that tends to encourage the population to get
involved in planning&mdash;because popular involvement threatens the
monopoly of power by business, and it also stimulates popular
organizations, and mobilizes people, and probably would lead to
redistribution of profits, and so on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: How about
just reducing taxes, instead of sending all this money into the
military-industrial complex?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You can&rsquo;t
reduce taxes much&mdash;because what else is going to keep the
economy going? Remember, it&rsquo;s been known since the Great
Depression that anything like free-market capitalism is a total
disaster: it can&rsquo;t work. Therefore every country in the world
that has a successful economy is somewhere close to fascism&mdash;that
is, with massive government intervention in the economy to coordinate
it and protect it from hostile forces such as too much competition. I
mean, there just is no other way to do it really: if you pulled that
rug out from under private enterprise, we&rsquo;d go right back into
the Depression again. That&rsquo;s why every industrial economy has a
massive state sector&mdash;and the way our massive state sector works
in the United States is mainly through the military system.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, I.B.M. isn&rsquo;t
going to pay the costs of research and development&mdash;why should
they? They want the taxpayer to pay them, say by funding a N.A.S.A.
program, or the next model of fighter jet. And if they can&rsquo;t
sell everything they produce in the commercial market, they want the
taxpayer to buy it, in the form of a missile launching system or
something. If there are some profits to be made, fine, they&rsquo;ll
be happy to make the profits&mdash;but they always want the public
subsidies to keep flowing. And that&rsquo;s exactly how it&rsquo;s
worked in general in the United States for the past fifty years.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for example, in
the 1950s computers were not marketable, they just weren&rsquo;t good
enough to sell in the market&mdash;so taxpayers paid 100 percent of
the costs of developing them, through the military system (along with
85 percent of research and development for electronics generally, in
fact). By the 1960s, computers began to be marketable&mdash;and they
were handed over to the private corporations so they could make the
profits from them; still, about 50 percent of the costs of computer
development were paid by the American taxpayer in the 1960s.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">3</font></sup>
In the 1980s, there was a big new &ldquo;fifthgeneration&rdquo;
computer project&mdash;they were developing new fancy software, new
types of computers, and so on&mdash;and the development of all of
that was extremely expensive. So therefore it went straight back to
the taxpayer to foot the bills again&mdash;that&rsquo;s what S.D.I.
[the Strategic Defense Initiative] was about, &ldquo;Star Wars.&rdquo;
Star Wars is basically a technique for subsidizing high-technology
industry. Nobody believes that it&rsquo;s a defense system&mdash;I
mean, maybe <i>Reagan</i> believes it, but nobody whose head is
screwed on believes that Star Wars is a military system. It&rsquo;s
simply a way to subsidize the development of the next generation of
high technology&mdash;fancy software, complicated computer systems,
fifth-generation computers, lasers, and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">4</font></sup>
And if anything marketable comes out of all that, okay, then the
taxpayer will be put aside as usual, and it&rsquo;ll go to the
corporations to make the profits off it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, just take a
look at the parts of the American economy that are competitive
internationally: it&rsquo;s agriculture, which gets massive state
subsidies; the cutting edge of high-tech industry, which is paid for
by the Pentagon; and the pharmaceutical industry, which is heavily
subsidized through  public science funding&mdash;those are the parts
of the economy that function competitively. And the same thing is
true of every other country in the world: the successful economies
are the ones that have a big government sector. I mean, capitalism is
fine for the Third World&mdash;we love <i>them</i> to be inefficient.
But we&rsquo;re not going to accept it. And what&rsquo;s more, this
has been true since the beginnings of the industrial revolution:
there is not a single economy in history that developed without
extensive state intervention, like high protectionist tariffs and
subsidies and so on. In fact, all the things we <i>prevent</i> the
Third World from doing have been the <i>prerequisites</i> for
development everywhere else&mdash;I think that&rsquo;s without
exception. So to return to your question, there just is no way to cut
taxes very much without the entire economy collapsing.</p>

Permanent War Economy<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I&rsquo;m a
little surprised to hear you say that the Pentagon is so important to
our economy.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There&rsquo;s hardly
an element of advanced-technology industry in the United States
that&rsquo;s <i>not</i> tied into the Pentagon system&mdash;which
includes N.A.S.A., the Department of Energy [which produces nuclear
weapons], that whole apparatus. In fact, that&rsquo;s basically what
the Pentagon&rsquo;s <i>for</i>, and that&rsquo;s also why its budget
always stays pretty much the same. I mean, the Pentagon budget is
higher in real terms than it was under Nixon&mdash;and to the extent
that it&rsquo;s declined in recent years, it&rsquo;s in fact had the
effect of what they call &ldquo;harming the economy.&rdquo; For
instance, the Pentagon budget started to decline in 1986, and in 1987
real wages started to fall off for skilled workers, in other words
for the college-educated. Before that they&rsquo;d been declining for
unskilled workers, and they started to go down for the
college-educated a year after the Pentagon budget began to drop off a
bit. And the reason is, college-educated people are engineers, and
skilled workers, and managers and so on, and they&rsquo;re very
dependent on the whole Pentagon system for jobs&mdash;so even a
slight decline in military spending immediately showed up in real
wage levels for that sector of the population.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">5</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, if you
look back at the debates which went on in the late 1940s when the
Pentagon system was first being set up, they&rsquo;re very revealing.
You have to examine the whole development against the background of
what had just happened. There was this huge Depression in the 1930s,
worldwide, and at that point everyone understood that capitalism was
dead. I mean, whatever lingering beliefs people had had about it, and
they weren&rsquo;t very much before, they were gone at that
point&mdash;because the whole capitalist system had just gone into a
tailspin: there was no way to save it the way it was going. Well,
every one of the rich countries hit upon more or less the same method
of getting out. They did it independently, but they more or  less hit
on the same method&mdash;namely, state spending, public spending of
some kind, what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;Keynesian stimulation.&rdquo;
And that did finally get countries out of the Depression. In the
Fascist countries, it worked very well&mdash;they got out pretty
fast. And in fact, every country became sort of fascist; again,
&ldquo;fascism&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t mean gas chambers, it means a
special form of economic arrangement with state coordination of
unions and corporations and a big role for big business. And this
point about everyone being fascist was made by mainstream
Veblenite-type economists [i.e. after the American economist Veblen]
right at the time, actually&mdash;they said, everybody&rsquo;s
fascist, the only question is what form the fascism takes: it takes
different forms depending on the country&rsquo;s cultural patterns.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">6</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, in the United
States, the form that fascism took at first was the New Deal
[legislative programs enacted in the 1930s to combat the Depression].
But the New Deal was too small, it didn&rsquo;t really have much
effect&mdash;in 1939, the Depression was still approximately what it
had been in 1932. Then came the Second World War, and at that point
we became <i>really</i> fascist: we had a totalitarian society
basically, with a command economy, wage and price controls,
allocations of materials, all done straight from Washington. And the
people who were running it were mostly corporate executives, who were
called to the capital to direct the economy during the war effort.
And they got the point: this worked. So the U.S. economy prospered
during the war, industrial production almost quadrupled, and we were
finally out of the Depression.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">7</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, then the
war ended: now what happens? Well, everybody expected that we were
going to go right back into the Depression&mdash;because nothing
fundamental had changed, the only thing that had changed was that
we&rsquo;d had this big period of government stimulation of the
economy during the war. So the question was, what happens now? Well,
there <i>was</i> pent-up consumer demand&mdash;a lot of people had
made money and wanted to buy refrigerators and stuff. But by about
1947 and &rsquo;48, that was beginning to tail off, and it looked
like we were going to go back into another recession. And if you go
back and read the economists, people like Paul Samuelson and others
in the business press, at that point they were saying that advanced
industry, high-technology industry, &ldquo;cannot survive in a
competitive, unsubsidized free-enterprise economy&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
just hopeless.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">8</font></sup>
They figured we were heading right back to the Depression, but now
they knew the answer: government stimulation. And by then they even
had a theory for it, Keynes; before that they&rsquo;d just done it by
instinct.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So at that point,
there was general agreement among business and elite planners in the
United States that there would have to be massive government
funneling of public funds into the economy, the only question was how
to do it. Then came kind of an interesting . . . it wasn&rsquo;t
really a <i>debate</i>, because it was settled before it was started,
but the issue was at least raised: should the government pursue
military spending or social spending? Well, it was quickly made very
clear in those discussions that the route that government spending
was going to have to take was military. And that was not  for reasons
of economic efficiency, nothing of the sort&mdash;it was just for
straight power reasons, like the ones I mentioned: military spending
doesn&rsquo;t redistribute wealth, it&rsquo;s not democratizing, it
doesn&rsquo;t create popular constituencies or encourage people to
get involved in decision-making.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">9</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s just a straight gift to the corporate manager, period.
It&rsquo;s a cushion for managerial decisions that says, &ldquo;No
matter what you do, you&rsquo;ve got a cushion down there&rdquo;&mdash;and
it doesn&rsquo;t have to be a big portion of total revenues, like
maybe it&rsquo;s a few percent, but it&rsquo;s a very important
cushion.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">10</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the public is
not supposed to know about it. So as the first Secretary of the Air
Force, Stuart Symington, put the matter very plainly back in 1948, he
said: &ldquo;The word to use is not &lsquo;subsidy,&rsquo; the word
to use is &lsquo;security. &rsquo; &rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">11</font></sup>
In other words, if you want to make sure that the government can
finance the electronics industry, and the aircraft industry, and
computers, and metallurgy, machine tools, chemicals, and so on and so
forth, and you don&rsquo;t want the general public trying to have a
say in any of it, you have to maintain a pretense of constant
security threats&mdash;and they can be Russia, they can be Libya,
they can be Grenada, Cuba, whatever&rsquo;s around.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
what the Pentagon system is about: it&rsquo;s a system for ensuring a
particular form of domination and control. And that system has worked
for the purposes for which it was designed&mdash;not to give people
better lives, but to &ldquo;make the economy healthy,&rdquo; in the
standard sense of the phrase: namely, ensuring corporate profits. And
that it does, very effectively. So you see, the United States has a
major stake in the arms race: it&rsquo;s needed for domestic control,
for controlling the empire, for keeping the economy running. And it&rsquo;s
going to be very hard to get around that; I actually think that&rsquo;s
one of the toughest things for a popular movement to change, because
changing the commitment to the Pentagon system will affect the whole
economy and the way it&rsquo;s run. It&rsquo;s a lot harder than,
say, getting out of Vietnam. That was a peripheral issue for the
system of power. This is a central issue.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, I&rsquo;ve
been arguing for years with friends of mine who are campaigning for
&ldquo;conversion&rdquo; of the economy from military production to
social spending that they&rsquo;re basically talking nonsense. I
mean, it&rsquo;s not that business has to be <i>told</i> &ldquo;for
this many jet planes we could have this many schools, isn&rsquo;t it
awful to build jet planes?&rdquo; You don&rsquo;t have to convince
the head of General Motors of that: he knew that forty years before
anyone started talking about &ldquo;conversion,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s
why he wanted jet planes. There is no point in explaining to people
in power that &ldquo;conversion&rdquo; would be better for the world.
Sure it would. What do they care? They knew that long ago, that&rsquo;s
why they went in the opposite direction. Look: this system was
designed, with a lot of conscious and intelligent thought, for the
particular purpose that it serves. So any kind of &ldquo;conversion&rdquo;
will just have to be part of a total restructuring of the society,
designed to undermine centralized control.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And I mean, you&rsquo;re
going to need an <i>alternative</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s not enough just
to cut off the Pentagon budget, that&rsquo;s just going to make the
economy collapse,  because the economy is dependent on it. Something
else has to happen unless you just want to go back to the Stone Age.
So the first thing simply has to be creating both a culture and an
institutional structure in which public funds can be used for social
needs, for human needs. That&rsquo;s the mistake that a lot of the
&ldquo;conversion&rdquo; people make, in my opinion: they&rsquo;re
just identifying what&rsquo;s obvious, they&rsquo;re not focusing
enough on creating the basis for an alternative.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: What is
the hope, then, for dismantling the whole military system?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There have to be
large-scale institutional changes, we need a real democratization of
the society. I mean, if we continue to have domination of the
economic and political system by corporations, why should they behave
any differently? It&rsquo;s not that the people <i>in</i> the
corporations are bad people, it&rsquo;s that the institutional
necessity of the system is to maintain corporate domination and
profit-making. I mean, if the Chairman of General Motors suddenly
decided to start producing the best quality cars at the cheapest
prices, he wouldn&rsquo;t be Chairman any longer&mdash;there&rsquo;d
be a shift on the stock market and they&rsquo;d throw him out in five
minutes. And that generalizes to the system as a whole. There is
absolutely no reason why the people who own the economy would want it
to be set up in a way that undermines or weakens their control, any
more than there&rsquo;s a reason why they would want there to be a
political system in which the population genuinely participates&mdash;why
would they? They&rsquo;d be crazy. Just like they&rsquo;d be crazy if
they opened up the media to dissident opinion&mdash;what possible
purpose would there be in that? Or if they let the universities teach
honest history, let&rsquo;s say. It would be absurd.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, that doesn&rsquo;t
mean that there&rsquo;s nothing we can do. Even within the current
structure of power, there&rsquo;s plenty of latitude for pressure and
changes and reforms. I mean, any institution is going to have to
respond to public pressure&mdash;because their interest is to keep
the population more or less passive and quiescent, and if the
population is <i>not</i> passive and quiescent, then they have to
respond to that. But really dealing with the problems at their core
ultimately will require getting to the source of power and dissolving
it&mdash;otherwise you may be able to fix things up around the edges,
but you won&rsquo;t really change anything fundamentally. So the
alternative just has to be putting control over these decisions into
popular hands&mdash;there simply is no other way besides dissolving
and diffusing power democratically, I think.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8564_2032848809"></a>Libyan
and American Terrorism<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Switching
to current events a bit, Mr. Chomsky&mdash;&ldquo;terrorism&rdquo; is
a phenomenon that really took off in the media in the 1980s. Why do
you think all of a sudden Libya became such a great threat to us?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, because from
the very first minute that the Reagan administration came into
office, it immediately selected Libya as a punching bag. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">12</font></sup>
And there were very good reasons for that: Libya&rsquo;s defenseless,
Qaddafi is sort of hateful and kind of a thug&mdash;a very small-time
thug, I might say, but nevertheless a thug&mdash;and he&rsquo;s also
an Arab, and there&rsquo;s a lot of anti-Arab racism around.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">13</font></sup>
And the Reagan administration needed to create fear: it had to
mobilize the population to do things they didn&rsquo;t want to do,
like support a massive increase in military spending.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, Reagan could
<i>talk</i> about the &ldquo;Evil Empire,&rdquo; but he couldn&rsquo;t
get into any confrontations with the Evil Empire&mdash;because that&rsquo;s
dangerous; the Soviets can fight back, and they&rsquo;ve got missiles
and things like that. So the trick was to find somebody who&rsquo;s
frightening enough to scare Americans into accepting a huge military
build-up, but nevertheless weak enough so you could beat him up
without anyone fighting back. And the answer was Qaddafi, and
international terrorism generally.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">International
terrorism by Arabs is certainly real. I mean, overwhelmingly
international terrorism comes out of Washington and Miami, but there
is a relatively small amount of it that comes from the Arab world.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">14</font></sup>
And people don&rsquo;t like it&mdash;they blow up planes, and it&rsquo;s
scary, and it&rsquo;s Arabs, it&rsquo;s weird-looking guys who have
dark faces and mustaches. How does it become a big enough threat that
we have to build more missiles and so on? Well, it&rsquo;s
<i>Kremlin-directed</i> international terrorism.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">15</font></sup>
This stuff was crafted from the first moment&mdash;and furthermore,
it was all utterly transparent right from the very beginning, like I
was writing about it as early as 1981.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">16</font></sup>
The media pretend they don&rsquo;t understand it, scholarship
pretends it doesn&rsquo;t understand it, but it&rsquo;s been as
predictable as a broken record: they put it on in 1981, and it&rsquo;s
still playing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The whole media
campaign on terrorism started with a series of C.I.A. disinformation
releases about Libya. In 1981 the C.I.A. leaked a story to the press
about U.S. efforts to assassinate Qaddafi, in the hope that this
would lead Qaddafi to some kind of erratic reaction which we could
then use as an excuse to bomb him. Okay, that was exposed: the first
reference to C.I.A. disinformation about Libya appeared in <i>Newsweek</i>
in August 1981, when <i>Newsweek</i> stated that it had been
subjected to a disinformation campaign by the government.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">17</font></sup>
Since then, there have been about a half-dozen similar cases in which
Washington floated some lunatic story about Libya and the media
bought it, then discovered later that it was disinformation and
pretended they were all surprised; I mean, at some point you&rsquo;d
think they would begin to ask what&rsquo;s going on, but apparently
not. And some of  these cases were completely crazy&mdash;there was a
story about Libyan hitmen wandering around Washington, S.W.A.T. teams
on alert patrolling the White House, that kind of thing. It was all
total madness. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">18</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, every one of
these confrontations with Libya has been timed for some domestic
purpose. The big one, the bombing of Libya in April 1986, was timed
for the contra aid vote in Congress&mdash;the point was to build up a
lot of hysteria beforehand, and it kind of worked: they rammed
through a big aid package a month or two later.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">19</font></sup>
It was all a complete set-up, totally prefabricated. First, a
confrontation was arranged in which Libyan artillery guns fired at a
U.S. fighter plane. You&rsquo;ll notice that somehow it&rsquo;s
always the <i>U.S.</i> Navy or the <i>U.S.</i> Air Force that Libya
is shooting at&mdash;they never shoot at <i>Italian</i> planes, or
<i>French</i> planes, or <i>Spanish</i> planes, it&rsquo;s always
American planes. Well, what&rsquo;s the reason? One possibility is
the Libyans are insane: they go after the people who are going to
wipe them out. The other possibility is that the Americans are <i>trying</i>
to get shot at, which is of course the truth. The reason the Libyans
only shoot at American planes is because American planes are sent
over there to <i>get</i> shot at; nobody else sends planes into the
Gulf of Sidra, because there&rsquo;s no point in doing it, so
therefore they <i>don&rsquo;t</i> get shot at.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, Libya says the
Gulf of Sidra is a part of its territorial waters, and the United
States refuses to accept that. Well, there&rsquo;s a way that
countries can resolve such disputes: you take them to the World Court
and get a ruling; a law-abiding state does it that way. Alright, that
option was raised in the United States, but the State Department
said, no, we can&rsquo;t do it, it&rsquo;s much too desperate a
situation; getting a decision from the World Court will take two
years. You know, we can&rsquo;t put off for two years whether the
U.S. Navy can go into the Gulf of Sidra, the United States will
collapse. All this stuff is so ludicrous you can barely repeat it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">20</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The beginning phase
of the 1986 confrontation occurred when American planes penetrated
Libyan territorial air space and finally got shot at&mdash;happily,
because they know they&rsquo;re never actually going to be hit by the
Libyan air defenses. They then flew back to the fleet, and the
American Navy bombed a bunch of Libyan navy vessels and killed lots
of Libyans. That was great, a real victory.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Following that, on
April 5th, 1986, a discotheque in West Berlin was bombed; two people
were killed. Rather crucially, one of them was a Turkish woman and
the other was a black American G.I.&mdash;the reason was, this was a
black Third World bar, not an insignificant fact. The White House
immediately announced that they had evidence, intercepts and so on,
that showed that this terrorist act was perpetrated by Libya, though
they never presented any of this evidence.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">21</font></sup>
Then nine days later, on April 14th, we bombed Libya.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It was completely
obvious that we <i>were</i> going to bomb them. In fact, I have a way
of monitoring the Associated Press wires on my personal computer, and
there were dispatches coming out all day because it was evident  we
were going to bomb them. So I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve ever
looked at a ticker-tape, but a story comes out about every minute,
and all through the day there were tons of stories coming out about
Libya; the last one before the bombing came through at 6:28 P.M. It
was bylined West Berlin, and it said: West German and U.S. military
intelligence say they have no information about any Libyan connection
to the disco bombing, but they suspect a possible Libyan connection.
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">22</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, half an hour
later, at precisely 7 P.M.&mdash;rather crucial, it was at 7 P.M.
<i>precisely</i>&mdash;the United States started bombing Libya. Why 7
P.M.? Because that&rsquo;s when the national news started on the
three U.S. television networks: this was the first bombing in history
ever timed for prime-time television, and I mean that literally. It
was a tricky operation to arrange: you had to synchronize a six-hour
flight from England so that a squadron of F-111 bombers would arrive
in Libya precisely at 7 P.M., when the three national networks began
their newscasts. They had to travel all the way across the
Mediterranean, two planes had to turn around and so on, but still
they hit it precisely at 7&mdash;that means there had to have been
extremely careful planning: they didn&rsquo;t want the bombing to
start at ten after seven, say, because that would have lost the
effect.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, every
journalist who isn&rsquo;t totally insane knew that this was a
set-up: I mean, how likely is it that you would get a bombing at 7
P.M. Eastern Standard Time, precisely on the nose? And if you watched
the news that evening, some of you will remember that the anchormen,
Peter Jennings and those guys, started off by saying: &ldquo;Alright,
we&rsquo;re going to switch over to Tripoli&rdquo;&mdash;then they
switched over to Tripoli, and there was the whole A.B.C. news team.
What the hell were they doing in Tripoli? They&rsquo;re never in
Tripoli. Well, they were in Tripoli because they knew perfectly well
there was going to be a bombing, that&rsquo;s why. I mean, they
didn&rsquo;t know the exact minute, but everybody was in place in
Tripoli because they knew the place was going to be bombed. Of
course, they all pretended it was this big surprise.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, 7 P.M., the
United States bombs Tripoli and Benghazi, kills plenty of people: you
go to the exciting events live, you hear the loud noises, the
television news is preempted because this is so exciting. Then they
flash back to Washington, and the Reagan administration spokesman,
Larry Speakes, gets on T.V., and for the next twenty minutes they
preempt the destruction to give you the State Department line.
Meanwhile, the whole Washington press corps is just sitting there,
these pussycats like Sam Donaldson and the rest of them, who would
never ask an embarrassing question in a million years. Speakes gets
up and says, &ldquo;We knew for certain ten days ago that Libya was
behind the disco bombing&rdquo;&mdash;and nobody asked the obvious
question: if you knew for certain ten days ago, how come you didn&rsquo;t
know half an hour ago? Barring colossal incompetence in the
newsrooms, every journalist there knew what I knew&mdash;they read
the A.P. wires at C.B.S. as much as I do, I guess, so that means they
knew that up until a half-hour before  the bombing, American and West
German intelligence had no information about a Libyan connection. But
Larry Speakes gets up and says, &ldquo;We knew for certain ten days
ago&rdquo;&mdash;and none of them even batted an eyelash. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">23</font></sup>
Nobody asked another obvious question: how come the bombing was
scheduled for 7 P.M. Eastern Standard Time? How did you set it up so
that a six-hour flight from London happened to arrive in Libya at
precisely the instant when the television news started in the U.S.?
Nobody asked that question. In fact, there&rsquo;s a whole series of
questions which nobody asked&mdash;everyone in the press just
swallowed the absurdities. Then Reagan got on and pontificated for a
while. Next day&rsquo;s news, a hundred percent&mdash;everybody said,
this is terrific, we finally showed these Libyans. Not a note of
discord.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">24</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, let me go on
with the personal side of this. Two weeks later, I happened to go to
Germany&mdash;where, incidentally, I was giving a talk at a
conference on terrorism. When I got off at the airport in Frankfurt,
the first thing I did was pick up the German newspapers, and I also
picked up <i>Der Spiegel</i>, which is kind of like the German
<i>Newsweek</i>. The front cover of <i>Der Spiegel</i> was a picture
of Reagan looking like some kind of madman with missiles going over
his head, and at the bottom was the phrase: &ldquo;Terror Against
Terror.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">25</font></sup>
Now, that happens to be an old Gestapo slogan: when the Gestapo went
after the anti-Nazi resistance, they called it &ldquo;terror against
terror.&rdquo; And I assume that everybody in Germany knew that it
was a Gestapo slogan&mdash;I guess that was the point, and especially
when you looked at the picture, the associations were pretty obvious:
they were saying, &ldquo;This is like the Nazis.&rdquo; And the whole
journal basically was devoted to exploding the theory that Libya had
anything to do with the disco bombing. They said, there&rsquo;s no
evidence for this, it&rsquo;s a total fabrication, Washington has
never provided any evidence. There were speculations as to who might
have done it, like it might have been drug-related, some people
thought it was Ku Klux Klan-related&mdash;the Klan is very strong
there, coming out of the American army&mdash;but there didn&rsquo;t
seem to be any reason why Libya would bomb a German Third World bar.
And in fact, while I was in Germany, I didn&rsquo;t meet a single
person who thought that there was any plausibility whatsoever to the
Libyan connection.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, I went to the
conference on terrorism, and afterwards there was a press conference.
At the press conference, I was asked by German reporters what I
thought about all of this, and I told them the little bit I knew.
After it ended, a guy came up to me, a black American from Dorchester
[in Boston], and introduced himself. He was a G.I. who&rsquo;d been
living in Germany for about twenty-five years&mdash;he&rsquo;d served
there, then decided he didn&rsquo;t want to come back, so he stayed;
a fair number of black Americans have done that, actually. Now he was
working as a reporter for <i>Stars and Stripes,</i> the American army
newspaper. Well, he told me that what I had said about the bombing
was part of the story, but that I didn&rsquo;t know the half of it&mdash;it
was much worse than I had said. I asked him what he meant, and he
said that as a reporter for <i>Stars and Stripes,</i> he had
regularly been interviewing the head  of the hundred-person West
German investigating team which was studying the disco bombing
[Manfred Ganschow], a man who also happened to be the director of the
West Berlin equivalent of the F.B.I. [the Berlin Staatsschutz]. And
he said that ever since the first day he began interviewing him, this
guy had been telling him: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no Libyan connection,
there&rsquo;s no evidence for it, we don&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo; I
asked him if he could get me something on paper about this that I
could publish, and he said he would.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">He flew to Berlin
and conducted another interview with this guy, then came back to
Frankfurt where I was, and gave me the transcript of the interview.
In it, he asked the guy: &ldquo;Do you have any new information about
a Libyan connection?&rdquo; And the guy said, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
been asking me that ever since the first day. I told you then we
don&rsquo;t have any evidence, we still have no evidence.&rdquo; The
reporter kept pressing. He said, &ldquo;Look, Helmut Kohl, the
Chancellor of Germany, now agrees that there&rsquo;s some
plausibility to Reagan&rsquo;s Libya story.&rdquo; And this guy said,
&ldquo;Well, politicians have to do what they have to do, and they&rsquo;ll
say their stuff, but I&rsquo;m just telling you what the facts are;
the facts are, there&rsquo;s no evidence.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">26</font></sup>
And it goes on from there. There never was any evidence. A couple
months later it even began to be <i>conceded</i> that there was no
evidence. So maybe Syrians did it, or maybe it was some other thing,
but the idea that there was any credible Libyan connection just
disappeared.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">27</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, on the
first anniversary of the bombing, the B.B.C. [British Broadcasting
Corporation] did a retrospective on the story in which they reviewed
all the background and went to European intelligence agencies for
assistance: their conclusion was that all of the European
intelligence agencies&mdash;including those from the most
conservative governments&mdash;say they see no plausibility to the
idea that there was a Libyan connection to the disco bombing.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">28</font></sup>
The whole thing was a lie. Nevertheless, it continues to be repeated
in the U.S. press.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">29</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, the B.B.C.
also presented some further interesting information. If you were
following all of this at the time, you&rsquo;ll remember that there
was a very dramatic story told in the U.S. media after the disco
bombing about how the United States had picked up secret intercepts
that Libya was going to bomb some target in West Berlin just before
the bombing, so they had declared an alert and were running around to
all the places U.S. soldiers go in West Berlin, and they got to the
discotheque just fifteen minutes too late&mdash;you remember that
story?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">30</font></sup> It
turns out it was a total fabrication. The B.B.C. investigated it:
neither the German intelligence and police nor any Western embassy
had ever heard about it&mdash;it was all completely fabricated.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the point is,
all of this stuff was known to American reporters. The <i>New York
Times</i> had a top-flight correspondent in Germany, James Markham,
and he was interviewing the head of West German intelligence too,
except he was never reporting any of this.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">31</font></sup>
In fact, none of it was ever reported, the press played the whole
thing as if they were completely blind&mdash;they pretended all the
way through that they didn&rsquo;t understand the business about the
timing; they didn&rsquo;t mention the fact that there was no evidence
 of a Libyan connection to the disco bombing right up to the moment
of the Tripoli attack; and they have yet to inform people that West
Germany itself never saw any evidence of a connection, and has always
regarded it as a total fabrication. All of that is just unstatable in
the U.S. media&mdash;and in this context, it&rsquo;s not very
surprising that the American population still believes the official
line. Well, here&rsquo;s an example of real brainwashing&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s just got to be conscious in this case, I can&rsquo;t
believe that the press is that incompetent.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, there&rsquo;s
even one more part to the Tripoli bombing story, that I know of at
least. Remember the Pentagon&rsquo;s version of why we had to bomb
Libya the first time: it was that American planes had been flying
over the Gulf of Sidra to establish our right to be there, they were
in international waters forty miles off the Libyan coast, they
detected Libyan planes pursuing them, they disabled the Libyan radar,
then in international waters, the Libyans shot at our
planes&mdash;therefore we had to shoot them down and sink their naval
boats, and ultimately bomb Tripoli a few days later and kill lots of
Libyan civilians. That was the Pentagon&rsquo;s story. Well, a couple
days after that, a very good, highly respected British correspondent,
a guy named David Blundy, went to Libya to investigate the story, and
he discovered the following. It turns out that at the time of the
first American attack, there were a bunch of British engineers in
Libya who were there making repairs on the Libyan radar systems&mdash;it
was Russian radar, but the Russians couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to
fix it, so they had to call in British engineers to fix it. So these
engineers were there working on the radar, and by the time of the
incident with the American fighter planes, the radar was working
perfectly well and they were in fact monitoring the whole episode
right as it transpired. And what they claim is that the American
planes were not in international waters, they had in fact flown
directly over Libyan ground territory: they had followed Libyan
commercial jets at first so they wouldn&rsquo;t be picked up on
radar, then they revealed themselves when they were over Libyan
ground territory, and at that point they picked up ground fire.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">32</font></sup>
And the purpose just had to be to <i>elicit</i> Libyan ground fire.
Then when they&rsquo;d been shot at, they went back out to sea and
bombed the boats and shot down the planes and so on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that has never
been reported in the United States. And that was very cautious
non-reporting&mdash;because the <i>New York Times</i> and others just
had to have been aware of this story, they just never mentioned any
of this information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I have a
student who was on active duty in the Mediterranean at that time, and
he says that the American Navy went within a very short physical
distance of the Libyan shoreline&mdash;not only within twelve miles,
but within three miles. He was right there on the deck and saw it.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s
probably the same story; that&rsquo;s interesting.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: What was
the point of it, though?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The immediate point
was pretty clear: right then the Reagan administration was trying to
create fanaticism in time for the Congressional vote on aid to the
Nicaraguan contras, which was coming up a few days later. In fact, if
anyone didn&rsquo;t understand this, Reagan drew the connection
explicitly in a speech he made. He said: you know these Libyans,
they&rsquo;re even trying to set up an outpost in our
Hemisphere&mdash;namely, in Nicaragua.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">33</font></sup>
In case anybody didn&rsquo;t understand . . .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I understand
the operation was a real military fiasco as well.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yes, there&rsquo;s a
very good study of that by Andrew Cockburn, who&rsquo;s quite a good
military correspondent.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">34</font></sup>
A couple of the planes broke down, the bombs were going all over the
place. I mean, they used laser-guided bombs&mdash;&ldquo;smart&rdquo;
bombs&mdash;and when laser-guided bombs miss, it means that something
got screwed up in the control mechanism, so they can go ten miles
away, they can go anywhere. I mean, no high-technology works for very
long, certainly not under complicated conditions, so all of these
gadgets were screwing up and the servicemen couldn&rsquo;t figure out
where they were. The night radar didn&rsquo;t work, a plane was shot
down&mdash;it goes on and on. And remember, this was with no enemy
opposition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It was the same with
the Grenada invasion [in 1983], actually&mdash;that was also a
military fiasco. I mean, seven thousand American elite troops
succeeded, after three days, in overcoming the resistance of about
three dozen Cubans and a few Grenadan military men; they got 8,000
Medals of Honor for it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">35</font></sup>
They mostly shot themselves, or shot each other. They bombed a mental
hospital. The airplanes were on a different radio frequency than the
ground troops. They didn&rsquo;t know there were two medical
campuses. In fact, there was an official report about it later by
some Pentagon guy [William Lind], who just described it as a total
fiasco.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">36</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They had the wrong
maps&mdash;and this is like bombing the Rowe Conference Center [i.e.
where Chomsky and the group were meeting], about that hard.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Are these
military planners rational?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There&rsquo;s a kind
of rationality. But remember, they&rsquo;re not really expecting to
fight a war against anybody who can fight back&mdash;like, they&rsquo;re
not planning on fighting the Russians or anything like that. They&rsquo;re
mostly doing counterinsurgency stuff against defenseless targets like
Libya and Grenada, so it doesn&rsquo;t really matter whether the
equipment works. The top brass  in the Pentagon, they basically want
a lot of high-powered, heavily automated gadgetry that&rsquo;s
expensive, because that&rsquo;s what makes you a big bureaucracy and
able to run a lot of things. I mean, there&rsquo;s an <i>economic</i>
purpose to the Pentagon, like I was talking about before: it&rsquo;s
a way to get the public to fund the development of high technology,
and so on. But the generals also want all this stuff too&mdash;it&rsquo;s
kind of a power play. So these generals would rather have high-tech
fancy aircraft than simple aircraft which just do the job, because
you&rsquo;re more powerful if you control more complicated stuff. The
perception they encourage is that everything&rsquo;s getting fancier
and fancier, and more and more complicated, so they need more and
more money, and more and more assistance, and more and more
control&mdash;and it doesn&rsquo;t really matter very much whether it
works properly or not, that&rsquo;s kind of secondary. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">37</font></sup></p>

The Grenada invasion was considered a big shot in the arm: we&rsquo;re
standing tall, they&rsquo;re not going to push us around anymore, all

</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, do you
see any positive role that the U.N. can play, for instance sending
U.N. peacekeeping forces to places instead of U.S. intervention
forces?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the U.N. can
only play a positive role if the great powers let it play a positive
role. So where the great powers more or less agree on something and
they just need a mechanism to effect it, the U.N. is useful. But if
the great powers are opposed&mdash;like, say the United States is
opposed to something&mdash;okay, then it just doesn&rsquo;t happen.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What about
if the U.N. didn&rsquo;t have a Security Council, or didn&rsquo;t
give veto power to the five permanent Security Council members? [The
U.N. Security Council has 15 seats, 5 of which are permanently
assigned to the U.S., Britain, France, Russia, and China, and for
&ldquo;substantive&rdquo; Security Council resolutions to go into
effect none of the 5 permanent members can have voted against them;
unlike the General Assembly, the Security Council has enforcement
powers.]</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It couldn&rsquo;t
happen&mdash;because the great powers will not allow any interference
with their affairs. Take the United States, which has been by far the
 leader in vetoing U.N. Security Council resolutions since the 1970s:
if we don&rsquo;t like what the U.N. is doing, the U.N. can go down
the tubes&mdash;we just ignore them, and that ends the matter.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">39</font></sup>
You don&rsquo;t kid around with an eight-hundred-pound gorilla, you
know.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, it&rsquo;s
quite interesting to trace the changes in the U.S. attitude towards
the U.N. over the years. In the late 1940s, the United States just
ran it completely&mdash;international relations of power were such
that the U.S. just gave the orders and everybody followed, because
the rest of the world was smashed up and starving after the Second
World War. And at the time, everybody here loved the U.N., because it
always went along with us: every way we told countries to vote, they
voted. Actually, when I was a graduate student around 1950, major
social scientists, people like Margaret Mead, were trying to explain
why the Russians were always saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; at the
U.N.&mdash;because here was the United States putting through these
resolutions and everybody was voting &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; then the
Russians would stand up and say &ldquo;no.&rdquo; So of course they
went to the experts, the social scientists, to figure it out. And
what they came up with was something we used to call &ldquo;diaperology&rdquo;;
the conclusion was, the reason the Russians always say &ldquo;no&rdquo;
at the U.N. is because they raise their infants with swaddling
clothes [bandages wrapped around newborn babies to restrain and quiet
them]. Literally&mdash;they raise their infants with swaddling
clothes in Russia, so Russians end up very negative, and by the time
they make it to the U.N. all they want to do is say &ldquo;no&rdquo;
all the time. That was literally proposed, people took it seriously,
there were articles in the journals about it, and so on. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">40</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, over the
years, U.S. power over the U.N. began to drop&mdash;at least
relatively speaking. A lot of Third World countries entered the U.N.,
especially in the 1960s as a result of decolonization, so there was a
lot more independence&mdash;and the U.N. just got out of control, we
couldn&rsquo;t order it around as much anymore. And as that happened,
you could just trace the U.S. attitude towards the U.N. getting more
and more negative. For instance, they started using this phrase which
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard, &ldquo;the tyranny of the
majority.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s the tyranny of the majority? It&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s known as &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; elsewhere, but when <i>we</i>
happen to be in the minority, it becomes &ldquo;the tyranny of the
majority.&rdquo; And starting around 1970, the United States began
vetoing everything that came up: resolutions on South Africa, on
Israel, on disarmament&mdash;you pick it, the United States was
vetoing it. And the Soviet Union was voting right along with the
mainstream. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">41</font></sup>
Okay, all of a sudden it turns out that the U.N. is a total disaster.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I&rsquo;ll never
forget one article about this in the <i>New York Times Magazine,</i>
by their U.N. correspondent, Richard Bernstein. He went through this
whole business about how the entire world votes against the United
States all the time. He wasn&rsquo;t asking, &ldquo;How do they raise
American children?&rdquo; What he asked was, &ldquo;Why is the world
out of step?&rdquo; Literally: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with
the world, it&rsquo;s all out of step, it doesn&rsquo;t
understand&mdash;what is it with the world?&rdquo; Then he began
looking for defects in the world. I&rsquo;m not  exaggerating, that&rsquo;s
exactly what it was like&mdash;and all of this stuff is done without
any self-consciousness, it&rsquo;s just said straight.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">42</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s the same
with the World Court [the popular name for the International Court of
Justice, the judicial organ of the U.N.]. When the World Court issued
an explicit decision against the United States in June 1986
ordering&mdash;<i>ordering</i>&mdash;the United States to terminate
what it called &ldquo;unlawful use of force&rdquo; and illegal
economic warfare against Nicaragua, we just said to heck with it, we
ignored them. The week after, Congress increased U.S. aid to the
contras by another hundred million dollars.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">43</font></sup>
Again, the commentary across the board in the U.S.&mdash;the <i>New
York Times</i>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, big international law
experts&mdash;was unanimous: the World Court has discredited itself
by passing this judgment, so obviously we don&rsquo;t have to pay any
attention to it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">44</font></sup>
It just discredits the World Court to criticize the United
States&mdash;that&rsquo;s like a truism here. Then right after that,
when the U.N. Security Council called on all states to observe
international law&mdash;not referring to the United States, but
obliquely referring to this World Court decision&mdash;and it was
vetoed by the United States (11 to 1, with 3 abstentions); and when
the General Assembly also passed the same resolution, the first time
94 to 3 (Israel, El Salvador, and the United States), the next time
94 to 2 (Israel and the United States)&mdash;the press wouldn&rsquo;t
even report it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">45</font></sup>
Well, that&rsquo;s what it means to be a great power: you do whatever
you feel like.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And by now, the
United States is practically strangling the U.N.&mdash;we&rsquo;re by
far its biggest debtor nation. In fact, the U.N. can barely function
because the United States won&rsquo;t pay its bills.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">46</font></sup>
And parts of the U.N. that we don&rsquo;t like, like U.N.E.S.C.O.
[the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization]&mdash;because it&rsquo;s working for the Third World&mdash;we
practically put them out of business.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The United States
launched a huge propaganda campaign against U.N.E.S.C.O. in the 1970s
and Eighties&mdash;it was full of outrageous lies, totally
fabricated, but nevertheless it sufficed to essentially eliminate the
Third World orientation of U.N.E.S.C.O. and make it stop doing things
it was doing around the Third World, like improving literacy and
health care and so on. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">47</font></sup>
But that&rsquo;s just the reality of what the U.N. is going to face
when it pursues policies that are not in the interests of the great
powers&mdash;it can just go down the drain, the United States won&rsquo;t
permit it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: But why is
it that the press won&rsquo;t report any of these things?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it&rsquo;s
because the press has a job: its job is to keep people from
understanding the world, and to keep them indoctrinated. Therefore it
won&rsquo;t report things like this&mdash;and again, that follows
pretty logically from the nature of the press institutions
themselves. In fact, the way that the U.S. press covers United
Nations votes gives a very good illustration of how it works. So for
example, when the U.N. has a vote denouncing the ongoing Russian
invasion of Afghanistan in November 1987, <i>that</i> they put on the
front page. But when the U.N. has a vote in the same session, in fact
within a few days, calling on all states to observe international
law&mdash;this very muted resolution after the World Court decision,
it didn&rsquo;t even mention the United States directly&mdash;then
they won&rsquo;t put it on the front page, in fact they won&rsquo;t
put it <i>anywhere.</i> <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">48</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take the summit
when the Soviet Union and the United States signed the I.N.F.
[Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces] treaty, in December 1987. Right
at that time, there was a tremendous amount of media attention
focused on arms treaties. Well, the line that the U.S. media
constantly presented was, &ldquo;Reagan the Peacemaker&rdquo;&mdash;you
know, &ldquo;Reagan leading us to a new age,&rdquo; &ldquo;First arms
control treaty [to abolish a class of weapons systems],&rdquo; and so
on. That was the standard picture across the whole American press.
Okay, that very month, the U.N. General Assembly had passed a series
of disarmament resolutions&mdash;but if you want to know the details
of them, you&rsquo;ll have to look them up in my book <i>Necessary
Illusions,</i> because it&rsquo;s about the only place you can find
them in print in the United States. The General Assembly passed a
resolution calling for the banning of all weapons in outer space,
Star Wars&mdash;it went through 154 to 1, the U.S. was the 1. They
passed a resolution against the development of new weapons of mass
destruction; it was 135 to 1. They passed one calling for a nuclear
test freeze; it was 137 to 3, the United States picked up England and
France on that one. And so it went.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Do you think any of
that made the newspapers in the United States? No, because that&rsquo;s
just the wrong story.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">49</font></sup>
The story is &ldquo;Reagan the Peace-maker,&rdquo; not &ldquo;The
United States is alone in the world, isolated in the world in
attempting to maintain the arms race&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s not
the story. And in fact, when the <i>New York Times</i> did its
summary report on what had happened at the U.N. that year, you can
bet your life that none of this stuff was included&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t
one word.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">50</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the point is, if
you want to be a &ldquo;responsible&rdquo; journalist, you have to
understand what&rsquo;s important, and what&rsquo;s important is
things that work for the cause&mdash;U.S. corporate power, that&rsquo;s
the cause. And you will not stay in the press very long unless you&rsquo;ve
internalized and come to understand these values virtually
intuitively&mdash;because there&rsquo;s a whole elaborate process of
filtering and selection in the institutions to eliminate people who
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> understand them and to help advance people who do.
That&rsquo;s how you can get commentators in the <i>New York Times</i>
asking questions like &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with the world?&rdquo;
when the U.S. is standing alone against every other country, and not
even batting an eyelash. And of course, it&rsquo;s also part of the
way the propaganda system keeps everyone else from understanding the
elementary realities too.</p>

Apartheid, and Racism<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Professor
Chomsky, one issue where I&rsquo;ve noticed that activists get kind
of a good press in the United States&mdash;and it seems out of synch
with what we usually see&mdash;is coverage of people protesting South
African apartheid [official system of racial segregation and white
supremacy, the legal basis for which was largely repealed in
1990-91]. I&rsquo;m wondering if you have any ideas why coverage of
that might be a bit more positive.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think you&rsquo;re
right: anti-apartheid movements in the United States <i>do</i> get a
pretty good press&mdash;so when some mayor or something demonstrates
against South Africa, there&rsquo;s usually kind of a favorable
report on it. And I think the main reason is that Western
corporations themselves are basically anti-apartheid by this point,
so that&rsquo;s going to tend to be reflected in the media coverage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, South Africa
has been going through an internal economic transformation, from a
society based on extractive industry to one based on industrial
production&mdash;and that transformation has changed the nature of
international interests in South Africa. As long as South Africa was
primarily a society whose wealth was based on extracting diamonds,
gold, uranium and so on, what you needed were large numbers of
slaves, basically&mdash;people who would go down into the mines and
work for a couple years, then die and be replaced by others. So you
needed an illiterate, subdued population of workers, with families
getting just enough income to produce more slaves, but not much more
than that&mdash;then either you sent them down into the mines, or you
turned them into mercenaries in the army and so on to help control
the others. That was traditional South Africa. But as South Africa
changes to an industrial society, those needs also are beginning to
change: now you don&rsquo;t need slaves primarily, what you need is a
docile, partially educated workforce.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Something similar
happened in the United States during our industrial revolution,
actually. Mass public education first was introduced in the United
States in the nineteenth century as a way of training the largely
rural workforce here for industry&mdash;in fact, the general
population in the United States largely was opposed to public
education, because it meant taking kids off the farms where they
belonged and where they worked with their families, and forcing them
into this setting in which they were basically being trained to
become industrial workers.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">51</font></sup>
That was part of the whole transformation of American society in the
nineteenth century, and that transformation now is taking place for
the black population in South Africa&mdash;which means for about 85
percent of the people there. So the white South African elites, and
international investors generally, now need a workforce that is
trained for industry, not just slaves for the mines. And that means
they need people who can follow instructions, and read diagrams, and
be managers and foremen, things like that&mdash;so slavery just is
not the right system for the country anymore, they need to move
towards something more like what we have in the United States. And
it&rsquo;s pretty much for that reason that the West has become
anti-apartheid, and that the media will therefore tend to give
anti-apartheid movements a decent press.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, usually
political demonstrations get very negative reporting in the United
States, no matter what they&rsquo;re for, because they show people
they can do things, that they don&rsquo;t just have to be passive and
isolated&mdash;and you&rsquo;re not supposed to have that lesson,
you&rsquo;re supposed to think that you&rsquo;re powerless and can&rsquo;t
do anything. So any kind of public protest typically won&rsquo;t be
covered here, except maybe locally, and usually it will get very
negative reporting; when it&rsquo;s protest against the policies of a
favored U.S. ally, it always will. But in the case of South Africa,
the reporting is quite supportive: so if people go into corporate
shareholder meetings or something and make a fuss about disinvestment
[withdrawing investments from South Africa to pressure its
government], generally they&rsquo;ll get a favorable press these
days.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Of course, it&rsquo;s
not that what they&rsquo;re doing is <i>wrong</i>&mdash;what they&rsquo;re
doing is right. But they should understand that the reason they&rsquo;re
getting a reasonably favorable press right now is that, by this
point, business regards them as its troops&mdash;corporate executives
don&rsquo;t really <i>want</i> apartheid in South Africa anymore.
It&rsquo;s like the reason that business was willing to support the
Civil Rights Movement in the United States: American business had no
use for Southern apartheid, in fact it was bad for business.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, capitalism is
not fundamentally racist&mdash;it can exploit racism for its
purposes, but racism isn&rsquo;t built into it. Capitalism basically
wants people to be interchangeable cogs, and differences among them,
such as on the basis of race, usually are not functional. I mean,
they may be functional for a period, like if you want a
super-exploited workforce or something, but those situations are kind
of anomalous. Over the long term, you can expect capitalism to be
anti-racist&mdash;just because it&rsquo;s anti-human. And race is in
fact a human characteristic&mdash;there&rsquo;s no reason why it
should be a <i>negative</i> characteristic, but it is a human
characteristic. So therefore identifications based on race interfere
with the basic ideal that people should be available just as
consumers and producers, interchangeable cogs who will purchase all
of the junk that&rsquo;s produced&mdash;that&rsquo;s their ultimate
function, and any other properties they might have are kind of
irrelevant, and usually a nuisance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So in this respect,
I think you can expect that anti-apartheid moves will be reasonably
well supported by the mainstream institutions in the United States.
And over the long term, I suspect that apartheid in South Africa will
break down&mdash;just for functional reasons. Of course, it&rsquo;s
going to be really rough, because white privilege in South Africa is
extreme, and the situation of blacks is grotesque. But over time, I
assume that the apartheid system will erode&mdash;and I think we
should press very hard to make that happen: like, one doesn&rsquo;t
turn against the Civil Rights Movement because you realize that
business interests are in favor of it. That&rsquo;s kind of not the
point.</p>

the Vietnam War<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Mr.
Chomsky, what&rsquo;s really going on in Vietnam&mdash;is it just the
horrible dictatorship it&rsquo;s portrayed to be, and do you see any
prospects at all for social or economic recovery there?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, Vietnam&rsquo;s
a pretty tight and autocratic place&mdash;but it was obvious that it
was going to be that way. Don&rsquo;t forget, what we did to that
country practically wiped it out. You have to bear in mind what
<i>happened</i> there. Nobody here cares, so nobody studies it
carefully, but over the course of the Indochina wars the number of
people killed was maybe four million or more. [&ldquo;Indochina&rdquo;
was the French colony comprising the area of Vietnam, Cambodia, and
Laos; the United States attacked each of those countries in the 1960s
and Seventies.] Tens of millions of others were displaced from their
homes. Large parts of the country were simply destroyed. There are
still thousands and thousands of deaths every year because of our use
of chemical weapons&mdash;children are born with birth defects, and
cancers, and tumors, deformities. I mean, Vietnam suffered the kind
of fate there&rsquo;s nothing to compare to in European history back
to the Black Plague. It&rsquo;ll be a century before they can
recover&mdash;if then. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">52</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, by about
1970, my own view, and I wrote this at the time, was that either
nothing in the region would survive&mdash;which was a possibility&mdash;or
else the only thing that would survive would be North Vietnam, which
is a harsh, orthodox Marxist-Leninist regime. And the reason why only
North Vietnam would have survived is because under conditions of
tremendous violence, the only thing that survives is the toughest
eople.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">53</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, libertarian
structures are not very resilient&mdash;they can easily be wiped out
by violence, whereas tough authoritarian structures can often survive
that violence; in fact, one of the <i>effects</i> of violence is to
magnify the power of authoritarian groups. For example, suppose we
came under physical attack here&mdash;suppose a bunch of gangsters
came and wanted to kill us, and we had to find a way to survive. I
suspect that what we would do (at least what I would do) is to look
for whoever around here is the toughest bastard, and put them in
charge&mdash;because they&rsquo;d be the most likely to help us
survive. That&rsquo;s what you do if you want to survive a hostile
attack: you subject yourself to power and authority, and to people
who know how to fight. That&rsquo;s in fact the <i>result</i> of a
hostile attack: the ones left in command at the end are the elements
who were capable of surviving, and usually they survived because
they&rsquo;re very violent. Well, our attack on Vietnam was
extraordinarily violent, and the more constructive National
Liberation Front in South Vietnam just couldn&rsquo;t survive it, but
the tough authoritarian regime of the North could&mdash;so it took
over.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And because the
pressures on them have never let up since the war, if there ever <i>were</i>
any possibilities for recovery afterwards, the United States has
ensured that Vietnam could never do anything with them. Because U.S.
policy since the war has been to make Vietnam suffer as much as
possible, and to keep them isolated from the rest of the world: it&rsquo;s
what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;bleeding Vietnam.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">54</font></sup>
The Chinese leadership is much more frank about it than we are&mdash;for
example, Deng Xiaoping [China&rsquo;s dominant political figure until
the 1990s] says straight out that the reason for supporting Pol Pot
in Cambodia is that he&rsquo;s Vietnam&rsquo;s enemy, and he&rsquo;ll
help us make Vietnam suffer as much as possible. We&rsquo;re not
quite as open about it, but we take basically the same position&mdash;and
for only slightly different reasons. China wants Vietnam to suffer
because they&rsquo;re an ideological competitor, and they don&rsquo;t
like having an independent state like that on their border; the
United States wants them to suffer because we&rsquo;re trying to
increase the difficulty of economic reconstruction in Southeast
Asia&mdash;so we&rsquo;ll support Pol Pot through allies like China
and Thailand, in order to &ldquo;bleed&rdquo; Vietnam more
effectively.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">55</font></sup>
[Pol Pot was the Cambodian Khmer Rouge Party leader responsible for a
mass slaughter in that country in the mid-1970s.]</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, remember
what the Vietnam War was fought for, after all. The Vietnam War was
fought to prevent Vietnam from becoming a successful model of
economic and social development for the Third World. And we don&rsquo;t
want to lose the war, Washington doesn&rsquo;t want to lose the war.
So far we&rsquo;ve won: Vietnam is no model for development, it&rsquo;s
a model for destruction. But if the Vietnamese could ever pull
themselves together somehow, Vietnam could again become such a
model&mdash;and that&rsquo;s no good, we always have to prevent
that.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">56</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The extent of the
sadism on this is extraordinary, in fact. For example, India tried to
send a hundred buffalo to Vietnam, because the buffalo herds there
had been virtually wiped out&mdash;Vietnam&rsquo;s a peasant society,
remember, so buffalo mean tractors, fertilizer, and so on; the United
States threatened to cut off &ldquo;Food for Peace&rdquo; aid to
India if they did it. We tried to block Mennonites from sending wheat
to Vietnam. We&rsquo;ve effectively cut off all foreign aid to them
over the past twenty years, by pressuring other countries not to give
them anything.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">57</font></sup>
And the only purpose of all these things has been to make Vietnam
suffer as much as possible, and to prevent them from ever
developing&mdash;and they&rsquo;ve just been unable to deal with it.
Whatever minuscule hopes they might have had have been eliminated,
because they&rsquo;ve made error after error in terms of economic
reconstruction. I mean, in the last couple years, they&rsquo;ve tried
to fool around with liberalizing markets to attract foreign investors
and so on, but it&rsquo;s pretty hard to envision any positive
scenario for them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, to try to deal
with economic problems in general is not so simple&mdash;the United
States is doing a rotten job of it, with all the advantages in the
world. And to deal with problems of economic reconstruction under
conditions of total devastation, and lack of resources, and imposed
isolation from the world&mdash;that&rsquo;s very, very hard. I mean,
economic development in the West was a very brutal process, and that
was under pretty good conditions. For example, the American colonies
in the eighteenth century were  objectively better off than most
Third World countries today&mdash;that&rsquo;s in <i>absolute</i>
terms, not relative terms, meaning you had to work less to feed
yourself, things like that.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">58</font></sup>
And economic development here still was very brutal, even with those
enormous advantages. And remember, that was with all of the resources
in the world still around to be robbed&mdash;nobody has that anymore,
they&rsquo;ve all been robbed already. So there are just real,
qualitative differences in the problems of Third World development
today&mdash;and the Vietnamese have problems far beyond that,
problems they simply cannot overcome at this point, as far as I can
see.</p>

the United States and Pol Pot<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You said
that we support Pol Pot in Cambodia through our allies. Isn&rsquo;t
there a chance that there could be another genocide there if the
Khmer Rouge gets back in power? I&rsquo;m terrified of that
possibility.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, it&rsquo;s
dangerous. What will happen there depends on whether the West
continues to support them . . .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But we may
be heading for another genocide.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, look, the
business about &ldquo;genocide&rdquo; you&rsquo;ve got to be a little
careful about. Pol Pot was obviously a major mass murderer, but it&rsquo;s
not clear that Pol Pot killed very many more people&mdash;or even
<i>more</i> people&mdash;than the <i>United States</i> killed in
Cambodia in the first half of the 1970s. We only talk about
&ldquo;genocide&rdquo; when other people do the killing. [The U.S.
bombed and invaded Cambodia beginning in 1969, and supported
anti-Parliamentary right-wing forces in a civil war there which
lasted until 1975; Pol Pot ruled the country between 1975 and &rsquo;78.]</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So there&rsquo;s a
lot of uncertainty about just what the scale was of the Pol Pot
massacre, but the best scholarly work in existence today estimates
the deaths in Cambodia from all causes during the Pol Pot period in
the hundreds of thousands, maybe as much as a million.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">60</font></sup>
Well, just take a look at the killing in Cambodia that happened in
the first half of the decade from 1970 to 1975&mdash;which is the
period that <i>we&rsquo;re</i> responsible for: it was also in the
hundreds of thousands.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">61</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Furthermore, if you
really want to be serious about it&mdash;let&rsquo;s say a million
people died in the Pol Pot years, let&rsquo;s take a higher
number&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth bearing in mind that when the United
States stopped its attacks on inner Cambodia in 1975, American and
other Western officials predicted that in the  aftermath, about a
million more Cambodians would die just from the <i>effects</i> of the
American war.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">62</font></sup>
At the time that the United States withdrew from Cambodia, people
were dying from starvation in the city of Phnom Penh alone&mdash;forget
the rest of the country&mdash;at the rate of 100,000 a year.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">63</font></sup>
The last U.S. A.I.D. [Agency for International Development] mission
in Cambodia predicted that there would have to be two years of slave
labor and starvation before the country could even begin to get
moving again.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">64</font></sup>
So while the number of deaths you should attribute to the United
States during the Pol Pot period isn&rsquo;t a simple calculation to
make, obviously it&rsquo;s a lot&mdash;when you wipe out a country&rsquo;s
agricultural system and drive a million people out of their homes and
into a city as refugees, yeah, a lot of people are going to die. And
the responsibility for their deaths is not with the regime that took
over afterwards, it&rsquo;s with the people who <i>made</i> it that
way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And in fact, there&rsquo;s
an even more subtle point to be made&mdash;but not an insignificant
one. That is: why did Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge carry out their
massacre in the first place? Well, there&rsquo;s pretty good evidence
that the Khmer Rouge forces took power primarily because they were
the only ones who were tough enough bastards to survive the U.S.
attacks. And given the destructive psychological effects of the
American bombings on the peasant population there, some sort of
violent outpouring was fairly predictable&mdash;and there was a big
element of just plain peasant revenge in what happened. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">65</font></sup>
So the U.S. bombings hit a real peak of ferocity in around 1973, and
that&rsquo;s the same period in which the Pol Pot group started
gaining power. The American bombardment was certainly a significant
factor, possibly the critical factor, in building up peasant support
for the Khmer Rouge in the first place; before that, they had been a
pretty marginal element. Okay, if we were honest about the term
&ldquo;genocide,&rdquo; we would divide up the deaths in the Pol Pot
period into a major part which is <i>our</i> responsibility, which is
the responsibility of the United States.</p>

and Anti-Heroes<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, I have
to say, I&rsquo;m getting a little depressed by all of this negative
information&mdash;we need it, there&rsquo;s no question about it, but
we also need a certain degree of empowerment. So let me just ask you,
who are your heroes?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, let me first
just make a remark about the &ldquo;empowerment&rdquo; point, which
comes up again and again. I never know exactly how to respond to
it&mdash;because it&rsquo;s just the wrong question. The point is,
there are lots of opportunities to do things, and if people do
something with them, changes will happen. No matter how you look at
it, it seems to me that&rsquo;s always what it comes down to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Well, I
guess I&rsquo;m asking about your heroes so that you&rsquo;ll be a
little bit more specific about some of these &ldquo;opportunities.&rdquo;
For example, who do you really admire when it comes to activism?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, my heroes are
people who were working with S.N.C.C. [the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee, a Civil Rights Movement organization] in the
South&mdash;people who day after day faced very harsh conditions and
suffered badly, some of them were even killed. They&rsquo;ll never
enter into history, but I knew some of them, I saw some of
them&mdash;they&rsquo;re heroes. Draft resisters during the Vietnam
War I think are heroes. Plenty of people in the Third World are
heroes: if you ever have the chance to go to a place where people are
really struggling&mdash;like the West Bank, Nicaragua, Laos&mdash;there&rsquo;s
an awful lot of heroism, just an awful lot of heroism. Among sort of
middle-class organizers, there are three or four people I know who
would get the Nobel Peace Prize if it meant anything, which of course
it doesn&rsquo;t, in fact it&rsquo;s kind of an insult to get it&mdash;take
a look at who it goes to.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">66</font></sup>
If you look around, there are people like that: if you want heroes,
you can find them. You&rsquo;re not going to find them among anybody
whose name is mentioned in the newspapers&mdash;if they&rsquo;re
there, you know probably they&rsquo;re not heroes, they&rsquo;re
anti-heroes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, there are
plenty of people who when some popular movement gets going are
willing to stand up and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your leader&rdquo;&mdash;the
Eugene McCarthy phenomenon. Eugene McCarthy [a contender for the
Democratic Party Presidential nomination in 1968] is a perfect
example of it. I remember John Kenneth Galbraith [American economist]
once saying, &ldquo;McCarthy&rsquo;s the real hero of the Vietnam War
opposition,&rdquo; and American liberalism always writes about him as
a great hero.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">67</font></sup>
Well, if you take a look at McCarthy&rsquo;s history, you can
understand why. During the <i>hard</i> years of building up the
anti-war movement, nobody ever heard of Eugene McCarthy. There were
some people in Congress involved in opposing the war, but it wasn&rsquo;t
McCarthy; in fact, it wasn&rsquo;t even McGovern, if you want to know
the truth&mdash;it was Wayne Morse, Ernest Gruening, Gaylord Nelson,
maybe a couple of others, but certainly not McCarthy. In fact, you
never even <i>heard</i> of Eugene McCarthy until around the time of
the Tet Offensive [in January 1968]. Around the time of the Tet
Offensive, corporate America turned against the war, there was a huge
mass popular movement out there, and Eugene McCarthy figured that he
could get some personal power out of it, so he announced himself as
&ldquo;Your Leader.&rdquo; He didn&rsquo;t really say anything&mdash;if
you look back, you don&rsquo;t even know which side he was on, if you
read the words&mdash;but somehow he managed to put across the
impression that he was this big anti-war leader.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">He won the New
Hampshire primary in &rsquo;68 and went to the Democratic National
Convention. At the Democratic Convention, lots and lots of young
people showed up to work on his campaign&mdash;you know, &ldquo;Clean
for Gene&rdquo; and so on&mdash;and they got battered bloody by the
Chicago police [in a police riot with anti-war demonstrators].
McCarthy didn&rsquo;t bat an eyelash,  he never even came down to
talk to them. He didn&rsquo;t win at the 1968 Convention, so he
disappeared. He had a lot of prestige at that point&mdash;totally
undeserved&mdash;but he had a lot of prestige as the self-elected
spokesman of the anti-war movement, and if he&rsquo;d cared even
marginally about anything he was saying, he would have used that
undeserved status to work against the war. But he quit: the power
game was over, it was more fun to write poetry and talk about
baseball, so that&rsquo;s what he did. And that&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s
a liberal hero&mdash;because he&rsquo;s a total fraud. I mean, you
couldn&rsquo;t have a more clear example of a total fraud.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, those are the
kind of &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; that the culture is going to set up for
you&mdash;the kind who show up when there are points to be gotten and
power to be gotten, and who try to exploit popular movements for
their own personal power-trips, and therefore marginalize the popular
movements. Then if things don&rsquo;t work out for them, they go on
and do something else: that&rsquo;s a &ldquo;hero.&rdquo; Or you
know, after you get shot, after you&rsquo;re killed, like Martin
Luther King, then you can become a hero&mdash;but not while you&rsquo;re
alive. Remember, despite all of the mythology today, Martin Luther
King was strongly opposed while he was alive: the Kennedy
administration really disliked him, they tried to block him in every
possible way. I mean, eventually the Civil Rights Movement became
powerful enough that they had to <i>pretend</i> that they liked him,
so there was sort of a period of popularity for King when he was seen
to be focusing on extremely narrow issues, like racist sheriffs in
the South and so on. But as soon as he turned to broader issues,
whether it was the Vietnam War, or planning the Poor People&rsquo;s
Campaign [a 1968 encampment and protest march on Washington], or
other things like that, he became a total pariah, and was actively
opposed.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">68</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I. F. Stone is
another case like that. I. F. Stone is a great hero of the press&mdash;they
all talk about, &ldquo;Boy, if we only had more people like Izzy
Stone&rdquo; and so on. But if you take a look at the actual record,
it&rsquo;s kind of revealing; I did it once. Up until 1971, Izzy
Stone was a total outcast, his name wasn&rsquo;t even mentioned&mdash;and
the reason is, he was publishing his radical news weekly [<i>I. F.
Stone&rsquo;s Weekly</i>]. There were a lot of journalists ripping it
off, but this guy was a Communist, so you don&rsquo;t ever want to
mention him. Then in 1971, he couldn&rsquo;t continue putting out the
<i>Weekly</i> anymore because he and his wife were getting too old,
so they stopped publishing it&mdash;and within a year he won the
George Polk Award, there were films being made about him, he was
being hailed everywhere as the great maverick reporter who proved
what a terrific press we had, &ldquo;if only we had more people like
him,&rdquo; and so on. Everybody just plays along with the farce,
everybody plays along.</p>

</i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, I&rsquo;ve
noticed that in general there&rsquo;s a strong strain of
anti-intellectualism in American society.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When you say there&rsquo;s
&ldquo;anti-intellectualism,&rdquo; what exactly does that mean? Does
it mean people think Henry Kissinger shouldn&rsquo;t be allowed to be
National Security Advisor?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Well, I
feel there&rsquo;s a sense in which you&rsquo;re looked down on if
you deal with ideas. Like, I&rsquo;ll go back and tell the people I
work with that I spent the whole weekend listening to someone talk
about foreign policy, and they won&rsquo;t look at that in a positive
way.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, because you
should have been out making money, or watching sports or something.
But see, I don&rsquo;t call that &ldquo;anti-intellectual,&rdquo;
that&rsquo;s just being de-politicized&mdash;what&rsquo;s especially
&ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; about being concerned with the world? If
we had functioning labor unions, the working class would be concerned
with the world. In fact, they <i>are</i> in many places&mdash;Salvadoran
peasants are concerned with the world, they&rsquo;re not
&ldquo;intellectuals.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">These are funny
words, actually. I mean, the way it&rsquo;s used, being an
&ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; has virtually nothing to do with working
with your mind: those are two different things. My suspicion is that
plenty of people in the crafts, auto mechanics and so on, probably do
as much or more intellectual work as plenty of people in
universities. There are big areas in academia where what&rsquo;s
called &ldquo;scholarly&rdquo; work is just clerical work, and I
don&rsquo;t think clerical work&rsquo;s more challenging mentally
than fixing an automobile engine&mdash;in fact, I think the opposite:
I can <i>do</i> clerical work, I can never figure out how to fix an
automobile engine.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So if by
&ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; you mean people who are using their minds,
then it&rsquo;s all over the society. If by &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;
you mean people who are a special class who are in the business of
imposing thoughts, and framing ideas for people in power, and telling
everyone what they should believe, and so on, well, yeah, that&rsquo;s
different. Those people are called &ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo;&mdash;but
they&rsquo;re really more a kind of secular priesthood, whose task is
to uphold the doctrinal truths of the society. And the population
<i>should</i> be anti-intellectual in that respect, I think that&rsquo;s
a healthy reaction.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, if you
compare the United States with France&mdash;or with most of Europe,
for that matter&mdash;I think one of the healthy things about the
United States is precisely this: there&rsquo;s very little respect
for intellectuals as such. And there shouldn&rsquo;t be. What&rsquo;s
there to respect? I mean, in France if you&rsquo;re part of the
intellectual elite and you cough, there&rsquo;s a front-page story in
<i>Le Monde.</i> That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why French
intellectual culture is so farcical&mdash;it&rsquo;s like Hollywood.
You&rsquo;re in front of the television cameras all the time, and
you&rsquo;ve got to keep doing something new so they&rsquo;ll keep
focusing on you and not on the guy at the next table, and people
don&rsquo;t have ideas that are that good, so they have to come up
with crazy stuff, and the intellectuals get all pompous and
self-important. So I remember during the Vietnam War, there&rsquo;d
be these big international campaigns to protest the war,  and a
number of times I was asked to co-sign letters with, say, Jean-Paul
Sartre [French philosopher]. Well, we&rsquo;d co-sign some statement,
and in France it was front-page news; here, nobody even mentioned it.
And the French thought that was scandalous; I thought it was
terrific&mdash;why the hell should anybody mention it? What
difference does it make if two guys who happen to have some name
recognition got together and signed a statement? Why should that be
of any particular interest to anybody? So I think the American
reaction is much healthier in this respect.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: But I want
to point out that you&rsquo;ve told us about a number of books this
weekend which support some of the contentions you&rsquo;re making:
you would not know a lot of these things if you hadn&rsquo;t read
that material.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s
right&mdash;but you see, that&rsquo;s a reflection of <i>privilege</i>,
not a reflection of intellectual life. The fact is that if you&rsquo;re
at a university, you&rsquo;re very privileged. For one thing,
contrary to what a lot of people say, you don&rsquo;t have to work
all that hard. And you control your own work&mdash;I mean, maybe you
decide to work eighty hours a week, but <i>you</i> decide which
eighty hours. That makes a tremendous difference: it&rsquo;s one of
the few domains where you control your own work. And furthermore, you
have a lot of resources&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got training, you know how
to use a library, you see the ads for books so you know which books
are probably worth reading, you know there are declassified documents
because you learned that in school somewhere, and you know how to
find them because you know how to use a reference library. And that
collection of skills and privileges gives you access to a lot of
information. But it has nothing to do with being &ldquo;intellectual&rdquo;:
there are plenty of people in the universities who have all of this
stuff, and use all of these things, and they do clerical work. Which
is perfectly possible&mdash;you can get the declassified documents,
and you can copy them, and compare them, and then make a notation
about some footnote referring to something else. That&rsquo;s in fact
most of the scholarship in these fields&mdash;take a look at the
monographs sometime, there&rsquo;s not a thought in people&rsquo;s
heads. I think there&rsquo;s less real intellectual work going on in
a lot of university departments than there is in trying to figure out
what&rsquo;s the matter with my car, which requires some creativity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Okay,
let&rsquo;s accept that the auto mechanic is an intellectual&mdash;then
I think on the other side, we also have to accept that those people
who deal with books correctly, and aren&rsquo;t the clerical workers,
are also intellectuals.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, if by
&ldquo;intellectual&rdquo; you just want to refer to people who use
their minds, yeah, okay. But in that sense, I don&rsquo;t think that
people <i>are</i> anti-intellectual. For example, if you take your
car to a really hot-shot mechanic who&rsquo;s the only guy in your
town who can ever figure out what&rsquo;s wrong&mdash;the  guys in
the car manufacturing place can never do it, but this guy&rsquo;s
just got a real feel for automobiles; he looks at your car, and
starts taking it apart . . .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: She . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or she, or
whatever&mdash;you don&rsquo;t look down on that person. Nobody looks
down on that person. You admire them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: But people
do look down on people who read books.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But look, this guy
may have read books&mdash;maybe he read the manual. Those manuals are
not so easy to read; in fact, they&rsquo;re harder to read than most
scholarly books, I think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But I&rsquo;m not
trying to disagree, I just think that we should look at the thing a
little differently. There&rsquo;s intellectual <i>work</i>, which
plenty of people do; then there&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s called
&ldquo;intellectual <i>life</i>,&rdquo; which is a special craft
which doesn&rsquo;t particularly require thought&mdash;in fact,
you&rsquo;re probably better off if you don&rsquo;t think too
much&mdash;and <i>that&rsquo;s</i> what&rsquo;s called being a
respected intellectual. And people are right to look down on that,
because there&rsquo;s nothing very special about it. It&rsquo;s just
a not very interesting craft, not very well done usually.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In my own view, it&rsquo;s
wrong if a society has these kinds of differentiations. My own early
background was in a kind of Jewish working-class environment, where
the people were not formally educated and they were workers&mdash;like
somebody could be a shop-boy, or a seamstress or something like
that&mdash;but they were very literate: I would call them
intellectuals. They weren&rsquo;t &ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo; in the
sense that people usually talk about, but they were very well-read,
they thought about things, they argued about things&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
see any reason why that can&rsquo;t be what you do when you&rsquo;re
a seamstress.</p>

Sports<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Could you
talk a bit more about the role that sports play in the society in
de-politicizing people&mdash;it seems to me it&rsquo;s more
significant than people usually assume.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s an
interesting one, actually&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know all that much
about it personally, but just looking at the phenomenon from the
outside, it&rsquo;s obvious that professional sports, and
non-participation sports generally, play a huge role. I mean, there&rsquo;s
no doubt they take up just a tremendous amount of attention.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, I have the
habit when I&rsquo;m driving of turning on these radio call-in
programs, and it&rsquo;s striking when you listen to the ones about
sports. They  have these groups of sports reporters, or some kind of
experts on a panel, and people call in and have discussions with
them. First of all, the audience obviously is devoting an enormous
amount of time to it all. But the more striking fact is, the callers
have a tremendous amount of expertise, they have detailed knowledge
of all kinds of things, they carry on these extremely complex
discussions. And strikingly, they&rsquo;re not at all in awe of the
experts&mdash;which is a little unusual. See, in most parts of the
society, you&rsquo;re encouraged to defer to experts: we all do it
more than we should. But in this area, people don&rsquo;t seem to do
it&mdash;they&rsquo;re quite happy to have an argument with the coach
of the Boston Celtics, and tell him what he should have done, and
enter into big debates with him and so on. So the fact is that in
this domain, people somehow feel quite confident, and they know a
lot&mdash;there&rsquo;s obviously a great deal of intelligence going
into it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, it reminds
me in some ways of things that you find in non-literate or
non-technological cultures&mdash;what are called &ldquo;primitive&rdquo;
cultures&mdash;where for example, you get extremely elaborate kinship
systems. Some anthropologists believe these systems have to do with
incest taboos and so on, but that&rsquo;s kind of unlikely, because
they&rsquo;re just elaborated <i>way</i> beyond any functional
utility. And when you look at the structure of them, they seem like a
kind of mathematics. It&rsquo;s as though people want to work out
mathematical problems, and if they don&rsquo;t have calculus and
arithmetic, they work them out with other structures. And one of the
structures everybody has is relationships of kinship&mdash;so you
work out your elaborate structures around that, and you develop
experts, and theories, and so on. Or another thing you sometimes find
in non-literate cultures is developments of the most extraordinary
linguistic systems: often there&rsquo;s tremendous sophistication
about language, and people play all sorts of games with language. So
there are puberty rites where people who go through the same
initiation period develop their own language that&rsquo;s usually
some modification of the actual language, but with quite complex
mental operations differentiating it&mdash;then that&rsquo;s theirs
for the rest of their lives, and not other people&rsquo;s. And what
all these things look like is that people just want to use their
intelligence somehow, and if you don&rsquo;t have a lot of technology
and so on, you do other things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, in our
society, we have things that you might use your intelligence on, like
politics, but people really can&rsquo;t get involved in them in a
very serious way&mdash;so what they do is they put their minds into
other things, such as sports. You&rsquo;re trained to be obedient;
you don&rsquo;t have an interesting job; there&rsquo;s no work around
for you that&rsquo;s creative; in the cultural environment you&rsquo;re
a passive observer of usually pretty tawdry stuff; political and
social life are out of your range, they&rsquo;re in the hands of the
rich folk. So what&rsquo;s left? Well, one thing that&rsquo;s left is
sports&mdash;so you put a lot of the intelligence and the thought and
the self-confidence into that. And I suppose that&rsquo;s also one of
the basic functions it serves in the society in general: it occupies
the population, and keeps them from trying to get involved with
things that really  matter. In fact, I presume that&rsquo;s part of
the reason why spectator sports are supported to the degree they are
by the dominant institutions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And spectator sports
also have other useful functions too. For one thing, they&rsquo;re a
great way to build up chauvinism&mdash;you start by developing these
totally irrational loyalties early in life, and they translate very
nicely to other areas. I mean, I remember very well in high school
having a sudden kind of <i>Erlebnis</i>, you know, a sudden insight,
and asking myself, why do I care if my high school football team
wins? I don&rsquo;t know anybody on the team. They don&rsquo;t know
me. I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to say to them if I met them. Why do I
care? Why do I get all excited if the football team wins and all
downcast if it loses? And it&rsquo;s true, you do: you&rsquo;re
taught from childhood that you&rsquo;ve got to worry about the
Philadelphia Phillies, where I was. In fact, there&rsquo;s apparently
a psychological phenomenon of lack of self-confidence or something
which affected boys of approximately my age who grew up in
Philadelphia, because every sports team was always in last place, and
it&rsquo;s kind of a blow to your ego when that happens, people are
always lording it over you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is,
this sense of irrational loyalty to some sort of meaningless
community is training for subordination to power, and for chauvinism.
And of course, you&rsquo;re looking at gladiators, you&rsquo;re
looking at guys who can do things you couldn&rsquo;t possibly
do&mdash;like, you couldn&rsquo;t pole-vault seventeen feet, or do
all these crazy things these people do. But it&rsquo;s a model that
you&rsquo;re supposed to try to emulate. And they&rsquo;re gladiators
fighting for your cause, so you&rsquo;ve got to cheer them on, and
you&rsquo;ve got to be happy when the opposing quarterback gets
carted off the field a total wreck and so on. All of this stuff
builds up extremely anti-social aspects of human psychology. I mean,
they&rsquo;re there; there&rsquo;s no doubt that they&rsquo;re there.
But they&rsquo;re emphasized, and exaggerated, and brought out by
spectator sports: irrational competition, irrational loyalty to power
systems, passive acquiescence to quite awful values, really. In fact,
it&rsquo;s hard to imagine anything that contributes more
fundamentally to authoritarian attitudes than this does, in addition
to the fact that it just engages a lot of intelligence and keeps
people away from other things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So if you look at
the whole phenomenon, it seems to me that it plays quite a
substantial social role. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the only
thing that has this kind of effect. Soap operas, for example, do it
in another domain&mdash;they teach people other kinds of passivity
and absurdity. As a matter of fact, if you really want to do a
serious media critique right across the board, these are the types of
things which occupy most of the media, after all&mdash;most of it
isn&rsquo;t shaping the news about El Salvador for politically
articulate people, it&rsquo;s diverting the general population from
things that really matter. So this is one respect in which the work
that Ed Herman and I have done on the media is really defective&mdash;we
don&rsquo;t talk about it much. But this stuff is a major part of the
whole indoctrination and propaganda system, and it&rsquo;s worth
examining more closely. There are people who&rsquo;ve written about
it,  Neil Postman and others&mdash;I just don&rsquo;t feel enough
acquaintance with it to say more.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">69</font></sup></p>

European Activism and Canada<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Professor
Chomsky, I&rsquo;m wondering whether there are any lessons about
activism that you think we should learn from Western Europe&mdash;they
seem to be very far ahead of us in terms of political organizing and
strategies.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, I don&rsquo;t
agree&mdash;we&rsquo;re always looking for a savior somewhere, and
there isn&rsquo;t any. I mean, there are a lot of things that have
developed in the United States which have not developed in Western
Europe, and the popular movements here are much healthier in many
respects than the European ones&mdash;theirs are very
ideology-ridden: they&rsquo;ve got &ldquo;texts,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;theories,&rdquo; and all kinds of stuff that we don&rsquo;t
have, which we&rsquo;re lucky we don&rsquo;t have. There&rsquo;s
really been a lot of very successful organizing here over the years.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But there
are mass demonstrations there.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, but we&rsquo;ve
had mass demonstrations too&mdash;we just had one in Washington a
couple days ago [in support of abortion rights]. We know how to do
that stuff; it&rsquo;s not very hard. I mean, there are no big
secrets about any of this: there are very few lessons to transmit, so
far as I know. Look, people have been involved in very successful
organizing in the United States: the Civil Rights Movement, the
anti-war movement, the ecological movement, the feminist movement,
all of these things have been very successful developments.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What about
all the West European social-welfare policies, though?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s true,
they have a lot of social-welfare programs we don&rsquo;t have&mdash;but
that&rsquo;s true of Canada too, you don&rsquo;t even have to go all
the way to Europe. For instance, they have a functioning public
health insurance program in Canada, which we don&rsquo;t have here in
the United States. But see, that has to do with the extreme power of
private capital here, and with the fact that the capitalist class in
the United States is extraordinarily class-conscious, while the
working class is very diffuse and weak. So the result is, we don&rsquo;t
have a lot of things that by now are pretty much taken for granted in
every other industrial country: we have more homeless and less
health.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, you can look at
the specific historical particularities in the United States that
have made it that way&mdash;and that&rsquo;s worth doing&mdash;but
really it&rsquo;s not a big secret how to go about getting those
kinds of programs. And if  you want to understand what a reasonably
rational national health care program would look like, you don&rsquo;t
have to go very far. There&rsquo;s a good start, at least, right
across the border.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Why does
Canada have programs like that, though?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there you have
to look at the history: you have to ask, how has the history of
Canada been different from the history of the United States? And
there have been a lot of differences. For instance, one difference
had to do with the American Revolution&mdash;in the American
Revolution, a large number of people fled to Canada, lots in fact.
And a lot of them fled because they didn&rsquo;t like the
doctrinaire, kind of fanatic environment that took hold in the
colonies. The percentage of colonists who fled in the American
Revolution was actually about 4 percent, it was probably higher than
the percentage of Vietnamese who fled Vietnam after the Vietnam War.
And remember, they were fleeing from one of the richest places in the
world&mdash;these were boat-people who fled in terror from Boston
Harbor in the middle of winter to Nova Scotia, where they died in the
snow trying to get away from all of these crazies here. The numbers
are supposed to have been in the neighborhood of maybe a hundred
thousand out of a total population of about two and a half million&mdash;so
it was a substantial part of the population. And among them were
people from groups who knew they were going to get it in the neck if
the colonists won&mdash;blacks and Native Americans, for example.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">70</font></sup>
And they were right: in the case of the Native Americans, it was
genocide; in the case of blacks, it was slavery.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And actually, that
wasn&rsquo;t the only big migration to Canada which contributed to
some of the differences&mdash;there was also another major one around
the turn of the century, coming out of the American Midwest after the
Populist movement collapsed [the Populists were a political movement
that formed out of agrarian protest in the 1880s and broke apart
after 1896]. The Populists were the last gasp of large-scale popular
democratic politics in the United States, and they were mainly
centered in the Midwest&mdash;radical Kansas farmers and that sort of
thing. And when they were finally defeated and the Populist Party
dissolved, a lot of them just left. I don&rsquo;t know the numbers in
this case, but a fair number of them went to Canada, and in fact they
became part of the basis for the Canadian social-democratic movement
which developed after that, and was responsible for pushing through a
lot of the social-welfare programs in Canada. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">71</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Apart from that,
there are a lot of other things that have made Canada different. For
instance, the United States has always been a much more advanced
capitalist country, by far&mdash;corporations in the modern sense
were an American invention, and ever since the beginning of the
industrial revolution, corporate America has always been much more
powerful than its Canadian counterpart. This was a much richer
country; we kept trying to invade Canada; Canada&rsquo;s much more
sparsely settled and much less populous  than the United States; it
was part of the British Empire; they have the French-English split,
with Quebec there; and so on. So there are a lot of historical and
other differences between the two of them, and I think it&rsquo;s a
good question to look into in more detail. But the fact is, there are
advantages and disadvantages to the two countries. A lot of things
have been won in the United States that are good, and are a model for
other places&mdash;and as far as organizing is concerned, it&rsquo;s
the kind of thing you can do relatively freely here, free of the fear
of very much direct state repression. So there are things you can
learn everywhere: you can learn things from Nicaragua, you can learn
things from Vietnam, you can learn things from Western Europe, and
you can learn things from Canada. But if you want to go somewhere for
salvation, you&rsquo;re not going to find it.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8582_2032848809"></a>Dispelling
Illusions<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, in
general, how would you say ordinary people should go about trying to
dispel their illusions about the world&mdash;what&rsquo;s the best
way to start?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you don&rsquo;t
sit in your room somewhere and dispel illusions&mdash;very few people
are capable of doing that. I mean, some people are capable of doing
it, but most aren&rsquo;t. Usually you find out what you think by
interaction with people, otherwise you don&rsquo;t know what you
think&mdash;you just hear something, and maybe you accept it, or you
don&rsquo;t pay any attention to it, or something like that. You
learn about things because you&rsquo;re interested in the topic, and
when it&rsquo;s the social world, your interest in it often
involves&mdash;<i>ought</i> to involve, at least&mdash;trying to
change it, it&rsquo;s in that context that you learn. And you learn
by trying out ideas, and hearing reactions to them, and hearing what
other people have to say about the topic, and formulating programs,
and trying to pursue them, and seeing where they break down, and
getting some experience, and so on and so forth.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So dispelling the
illusions is just a part of organizing and acting. It&rsquo;s not
something that you do in a seminar, or in your living room&mdash;not
that you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> do it there, but it&rsquo;s just a
different kind of activity. Like, if you have some illusions about
classical Greece, let&rsquo;s say, then you can probably do it in the
library, to some extent at least. But if you&rsquo;re trying to
dispel illusions about a live, ongoing social process that&rsquo;s
changing all the time, and that you only get to see little pieces
of&mdash;that&rsquo;s really not the way to do it. You do it through
interactions with other people, and by functioning in some kind of
community of concern, and of commitment, and of activism.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: If I were to
hold a meeting in my community and invite someone to speak about the
kinds of things we&rsquo;ve been discussing this weekend, though, I&rsquo;d
probably get a very small turnout.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, that&rsquo;s
okay. Look, the peace movement in the Sixties became a huge mass
movement, with tens of millions of people involved: it began with
people doing just what you said, inviting somebody to come and talk
in their living rooms. I mean, I remember it, because I did that for
a couple of years. The world has just changed tremendously since
then. Now I&rsquo;m booked up two or more years in advance, I get
huge audiences, sophisticated audiences, people who&rsquo;ve thought
about things, they&rsquo;re active, I learn from them. It&rsquo;s not
long ago that I was getting invited to somebody&rsquo;s living room
to talk to two or three neighbors who were ready to lynch me, or to
some church where there&rsquo;d be four people, including some guy
who sort of wandered in because he didn&rsquo;t know what to do, and
two people who wanted to kill you, and the organizer&mdash;that&rsquo;s
not long ago, that&rsquo;s 1964. And when you&rsquo;re talking about
other issues, like large-scale social change, well, it&rsquo;s still
like 1964 in that respect. But things can change&mdash;and sometimes
they change very fast.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Take the Civil
Rights Movement in the United States: over a ten-year period, it was
just a sea-change. Or take the feminist movement, which a lot of you
are involved in: the changes came very fast. It went from being
virtually nothing, a little nit-picking about activist groups having
the women licking the stamps, and within a couple years it was a
major movement, swept the country. When the time is right, things
happen fast. They don&rsquo;t happen without any basis&mdash;things
have to have been happening for a long period. But then they can
crystallize at the right time, and often become very significant.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Although&mdash;I
do a lot of political work in my community, and after a while it does
begin to feel like preaching to the converted. It&rsquo;s very
frustrating.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It sure is. Activism
is very frustrating. But you also do get achievements: you bring a
couple people in, and they begin to do things, and sooner or later it
can lead to very large-scale change. We know that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, the old
American Communist Party&mdash;make any criticisms you want about it,
Stalinist, anything else&mdash;the fact is, there were some very
strong things about it. One thing is, there were a lot of people who
were just committed: they were going to show up when you needed
somebody to turn the mimeograph machine, because they were committed
that that&rsquo;s the way to get somewhere. And they were willing to
work, they were going to work for changes with other people in their
communities, whose lives they wanted to improve and help. And don&rsquo;t
forget, <i>they</i> were the people who were fighting for civil
rights in the days when it was no joke, when it wasn&rsquo;t a matter
of going down to Selma on a big march, it was a matter of being alone
in the South in places where you could very easily get killed&mdash;that
was mostly the American Communist Party. Everybody who dumps on the
Communist Party might remember these things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And also, don&rsquo;t
forget, a lot of the destruction that you see in the world happens
because people are constantly organizing, and advancing, and
progressing, and taking things over, and struggling against their
oppression. I mean, the fact that all of these atrocities have been
going on in Central America in the 1980s is a sign of <i>progress</i>,
you know. Up until around the late 1970s, nobody here even commented
on Central America. Why? Because it was <i>all</i> under control, it
was <i>pure</i> atrocities, nobody was fighting back&mdash;so
therefore no one here even paid attention to it. It only became an
issue in the 1980s because there was a great deal of very successful
organizing there: they <i>did</i> overthrow the Somoza regime in
Nicaragua, there were huge peasant unions being formed for the first
time in El Salvador and Guatemala, there was just a lot of extremely
effective organizing taking place. So then the death squads came, and
the U.S. trainers came, and people like you and me had to pay our
taxes to have those people murdered. But they still have not yet
eradicated it. Despite all the terror in Guatemala&mdash;you could
even call it something like genocide&mdash;the working-class unions
are reconstituting, they&rsquo;re still there. And crucially, in the
1980s that activism induced a solidarity movement in the United
States which has interacted very constructively with the people
there: that&rsquo;s an extremely important change, a dramatic change.
So when we talk about what governments are up to, of course
everything looks bleak. But look around&mdash;there are all kinds of
other things happening, and that&rsquo;s what <i>you</i> do.</p>

Alexander Cockburn say a couple days ago, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s still one

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Where would there be

that Time and Warner Communications can form a conglomerate? All of
this literature is not tied up with any form&mdash;<i>any</i> form, I
mean, not five people&mdash;of social organization that is trying to
undermine the corporate structure of the media. This work all is just
an effort to educate people so they&rsquo;re better able to protect
themselves from the propaganda system. And <i>there</i> I think there
has been an effect: a lot of people are attuned to propaganda in a
way they weren&rsquo;t before. But none of this can be conceived of
as an attempt to change the corporate structure directly&mdash;there
isn&rsquo;t even a <i>proposal</i> about that in any one of these
books. Take Ben Bagdikian&rsquo;s book, or the first chapter of Ed&rsquo;s

corporate capitalism, that&rsquo;s a completely different topic. They
just say, as long as you have corporate capitalism, here&rsquo;s what

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I am&mdash;not on
the elections themselves, on the <i>U.S. reaction</i> to the
elections. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">2</font></sup>
Nicaragua&rsquo;s for <i>them</i> to write about, I write about the
United States.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the reaction of
the media here was pretty astonishing. The most remarkable feature
was the unanimity. I mean, there was an absolutely unanimous reaction
across the entire mainstream spectrum, from Anthony Lewis and Mary
McGrory over to George Will and whatever other right-wing lunatic
there is. In fact, about the only difference between the so-called
&ldquo;liberals&rdquo; and &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo; was that the
liberals pointed to the fact that the Nicaraguan people essentially
voted with a gun to their heads and <i>then</i> said, &ldquo;The
election was free and fair, uncoerced, a miracle of democracy,&rdquo;
whereas the conservatives didn&rsquo;t bother saying the people voted
with a gun to their heads, they just said it was a miracle of
democracy.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">3</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Some of it was
comical. For instance, the <i>New York Times</i> had a column by
David Shipler, a liberal journalist, which said, yeah, the embargo&rsquo;s
killing them, the contras are killing them, they know we&rsquo;re
going to continue the embargo unless they vote for our candidate.
Headline: &ldquo;Victory For U.S. Fair Play.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">4</font></sup>
The <i>Boston Globe</i>, which is a very liberal newspaper&mdash;it&rsquo;s
the outer limit in the mainstream&mdash;had a headline: &ldquo;Rallying
to Chamorro.&rdquo; The theme was, okay, now all the people who love
Nicaraguans, like we&rsquo;ve all done all these years, must rally to
Chamorro.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">5</font></sup>
Well, say it was 1964, after Goldwater lost the Presidential race
here two to one&mdash;can you imagine anybody saying, &ldquo;Okay,
now every Goldwater voter must &lsquo;rally to Johnson&rsquo; &rdquo;?
That&rsquo;s straight out of Stalinist Russia. You don&rsquo;t &ldquo;rally
to the leader&rdquo; in a democracy&mdash;you do whatever you feel
like doing. But the idea that you&rsquo;ve got to rally behind <i>der
F&uuml;hrer</i> is quite acceptable in the American liberal press.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, it&rsquo;s
interesting that the media themselves even recognized the unanimity.
So for example, the <i>New York Times</i> had an article by Elaine
Sciolino surveying the U.S. reaction, and the headline was,
&ldquo;Americans United in Joy, But Divided Over Policy.&rdquo;<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">6</font></sup>
And the division over policy turns out to be the question: who gets
credit for having achieved this magnificent result? See, that&rsquo;s
where you get a liberal/conservative split: &ldquo;did the contras
help or hurt?&rdquo; Is it better to do it the way it&rsquo;s done in
El Salvador&mdash;leave women hanging from trees with their skin
flayed off and bleeding to death, leave thousands of corpses beheaded
by the roadside so that everybody else will get the point&mdash;or
should you do what Senator Alan Cranston suggested in 1986, to pick a
dove: let them &ldquo;fester in their own juices,&rdquo; through
economic strangulation and other means?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">7</font></sup>
Well, the fact is, the right wing wins on that one: the contras
obviously helped. But the idea that everyone was &ldquo;United in
Joy&rdquo; over the result, that was considered perfectly legitimate.
In other words, we&rsquo;re straight totalitarians: everyone is
united, we all march on command, there isn&rsquo;t one word of
dissidence tolerated. Phrases like &ldquo;United in Joy&rdquo; are
the kinds of things you might see in the North Korean press, maybe.
But it&rsquo;s interesting, American elites <i>pride</i> themselves
on being dedicated totalitarians, they think that&rsquo;s the way we
<i>ought</i> to be&mdash;we <i>ought</i> to be the worst totalitarian
culture in the world, in which everyone agrees.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, anyone can
see, a ten-year-old could see, that an election carried out under
conditions where a monstrous superpower is saying, &ldquo;Vote for
our candidate or starve to death,&rdquo; is obviously not free. I
mean, if some unimaginable superpower were to threaten us, saying,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to reduce you to the level of Ethiopia
unless you vote for our candidate,&rdquo; and then people here voted
for their candidate, you&rsquo;d have to be some kind of crazy Nazi
or something to say that it was a free election. But in the United
States, <i>everyone</i> says it&mdash;we&rsquo;re all &ldquo;United
in Joy.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s an interesting fact about the United
States, actually&mdash;what it shows is how deeply totalitarian the
culture really is. In fact, it would be very hard to mimic this even
in a well-run totalitarian state, but here it passes without anybody
even noticing it, because it&rsquo;s all so deeply ingrained. In any
country that had even a <i>memory</i> of what democracy means, if you
saw that everyone was &ldquo;United in Joy,&rdquo; the article would
say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something really wrong with this country.&rdquo;
Nobody can be &ldquo;United in Joy&rdquo; over anything. Pick the
topic, it just can&rsquo;t be that people are &ldquo;United in Joy&rdquo;
about it&mdash;unless it&rsquo;s Albania, then yeah, sure, you&rsquo;ve
got the guns pointed at you, you&rsquo;re &ldquo;United in Joy.&rdquo;
But in the United States, nobody even sees that there&rsquo;s
anything odd about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: There was
a breakthrough, though&mdash;the Wall Street Journal on its front
page ran an article written by a man from The Nation [a left-leaning
magazine] saying that we ought to be ashamed of what happened in
Nicaragua.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That wasn&rsquo;t on
the front page, that was on the Op-Ed page&mdash;and that was Alex
Cockburn, who&rsquo;s the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>&rsquo;s
once-a-month gesture to &ldquo;some other voice.&rdquo; Sure, I mean,
when I say the unity was a hundred percent, I know of precisely two
exceptions in the mainstream press in the United States. Obviously I
haven&rsquo;t read <i>everything</i> in the mainstream press, but
I&rsquo;ve looked at quite a lot, and I&rsquo;ve been in touch with
people all around the country who&rsquo;ve been looking, and I found
only two exceptions: one was Alex Cockburn in the <i>Wall Street
Journal</i>, and the other was an editor I know at the <i>Boston
Globe</i>, Randolph Ryan, who managed to put something about this in
an editorial.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">8</font></sup>
So the two of them were able to say what any eight-year-old would see
right off&mdash;and as far as I know, that&rsquo;s it for the
American press.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As a matter of fact,
it was the same in the coverage before the elections. I, and probably
you, and a lot of other people were following the media very closely
just to see if there would be <i>one phrase</i>, just a phrase,
anywhere in the mainstream media, that said that a Sandinista Party
victory might be the best thing for Nicaragua&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t
found a phrase. I mean, even journalists who <i>believe</i> it
couldn&rsquo;t say it. Now, obviously the issue is contentious&mdash;it
was contentious in Nicaragua&mdash;but here it&rsquo;s not, here you
have to have 100 percent unanimity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Furthermore, it was
also assumed automatically, across the board, that Chamorro was the
democratic candidate&mdash;and nobody ever gave you a reason <i>why</i>
she was the democratic candidate. I mean, what are her democratic
credentials? That&rsquo;s not anything you even have to argue in the
United States: Washington says she&rsquo;s the democratic candidate,
and American business says she&rsquo;s the democratic candidate, so
that settles it&mdash;for American intellectuals, there are no
further questions to ask. And the interesting thing is, again, nobody
even sees that there&rsquo;s anything odd about this. Like, nobody
writes an Op-Ed saying, &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it strange? Just because
Washington and the business community tell us she&rsquo;s the
democratic candidate, does that mean that we have to repeat it and
not look for some reason, find out what her democratic credentials
are?&rdquo; It wouldn&rsquo;t occur to anybody: the intellectual
community in the United States is so disciplined they simply don&rsquo;t
ask those questions.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yes.</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Well, he had
control of that country for ten years.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What does it mean,
&ldquo;He had control of it&rdquo;?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: He
controlled the press.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">He did not. In fact,
Nicaragua is the only country I know of in history that allowed a
major opposition press [<i>La Prensa</i>] to operate while it was
being attacked&mdash;a press which was calling for the overthrow of
the government by violence, which was identifying with the
foreign-run mercenary army attacking the country, and which was
funded, partly openly and partly covertly (though everybody knew), by
the foreign power attacking the country [i.e. the U.S.]. That&rsquo;s
never happened before in history&mdash;the United States would never
tolerate anything like that for one second. Furthermore, and quite
apart from that, large parts of Nicaragua were flooded, and in fact
dominated, by U.S. propaganda. Remember, there are large areas of
Nicaragua where what people know is what they hear over the  radio,
and the United States ran major radio and television stations in
Honduras and Costa Rica which dominated the information flow in large
sectors of the Nicaraguan countryside.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">9</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, the level
of freedom of the press in Nicaragua in the last ten years just broke
new libertarian standards: there&rsquo;s never been anything even
remotely comparable to it in history. Try to find a case.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But given
ten years in power, it seemed rather remarkable that Ortega wasn&rsquo;t
able to hold on to that mandate.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Really? Well let me
ask you how remarkable it is. Suppose the Soviet Union were to play
the game the way we do. Lithuania just declared independence, right
[in March 1990]? Let&rsquo;s suppose that the Soviet Union were
capable of doing what we did in Nicaragua. So: it would organize a
terrorist army to attack Lithuania; it would train it to attack &ldquo;soft
targets,&rdquo; civilian targets; it would try to kill large numbers
of health workers, teachers, farmers, and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">10</font></sup>
Meanwhile, it would impose an embargo&mdash;suppose it were able to
do this&mdash;and block trade, block export and import, it would
pressure international institutions to stop providing any
assistance.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">11</font></sup>
Of course, to make the analogy accurate, we&rsquo;d have to assume
that Lithuania begins at a level much lower than what it actually is.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, now suppose
that after ten years of this, Lithuania has been reduced to the level
of Ethiopia, alright? And suppose that then there&rsquo;s an
election, and Moscow says: &ldquo;Look, we&rsquo;re going to continue
this, all of it, unless you vote for the Communist Party.&rdquo; And
now suppose that the Lithuanians <i>do</i> vote for the Communist
Party. Would you find that remarkable?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I don&rsquo;t

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Oh yeah, they were.

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, but then why
do you find it remarkable when it happened in Nicaragua?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Well, I
don&rsquo;t have access to all the facts you do.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You have every fact
I told you&mdash;every fact I told you, you knew. Every fact I told
you you can find on the front pages of the <i>New York Times.</i>
It&rsquo;s just that when you hear the White House announce, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to continue with the embargo unless Chamorro wins,&rdquo; you
have to be able to think enough so you conclude, well, these people
are voting with a gun to  their heads.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">13</font></sup>
If you can&rsquo;t think that far, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the
newspapers say. And the beauty of a really well-indoctrinated
intellectual class is they <i>can&rsquo;t</i> think that far. They
can think that far <i>easily</i> in the case of Lithuania, but they
can&rsquo;t think that far in the case of the United States, even
though the actual situation is the hypothetical one that I described.
So often the information is <i>there</i>, in a sense&mdash;it&rsquo;s
just that it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> there, because people are so
indoctrinated that they simply don&rsquo;t see it.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Why is that?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Because if they have
the capacity to think freely and understand these types of things,
they&rsquo;re going to be kept out by a very complicated filtering
system&mdash;which actually starts in kindergarten, I think. In fact,
the whole educational and professional training system is a very
elaborate filter, which just weeds out people who are too
independent, and who think for themselves, and who don&rsquo;t know
how to be submissive, and so on&mdash;because they&rsquo;re
dysfunctional to the institutions. I mean, it would be highly
dysfunctional to have people in the media who could ask questions
like this. So by the time you&rsquo;ve made it to Bureau Chief or
Editor, or you&rsquo;ve become a bigshot at C.B.S. or something, the
chances are that you&rsquo;ve just got all this stuff in your
bones&mdash;you&rsquo;ve internalized values that make it clear to
you that there are certain things you just don&rsquo;t say, and in
fact, you don&rsquo;t even think about them anymore.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This was actually
discussed years ago in an interesting essay by George Orwell, which
happens to be the introduction to <i>Animal Farm. Animal Farm</i> is
a satire on Soviet totalitarianism, obviously, and it&rsquo;s a very
famous book, everybody reads it. But what people <i>don&rsquo;t</i>
usually read is its introduction, which talks about censorship in
England&mdash;and the main reason people don&rsquo;t read it is
because it was censored, nicely; it simply wasn&rsquo;t published
with the book. It was finally rediscovered about thirty years later
and somebody somewhere published it, and now it&rsquo;s available in
some modern editions. But in this essay Orwell said, look, this book
is obviously about Stalinist Russia, however it&rsquo;s not all that
different in England. And then he described how things work in
England. He said: in England there isn&rsquo;t any commissar around
who beats you over the head if you say the wrong thing, but
nevertheless the results are not all that different. And then he had
a two-line description of how the press works in England, which is
pretty accurate,  in fact. One of the reasons why the results are
similar, he said, is because the press is owned by wealthy men who
have strong interests in not having certain things said. The other,
which he said is equally pertinent, is that if you&rsquo;re a
well-educated person in England&mdash;you went to the right prep
schools, then to Oxford, and now you&rsquo;re a bigshot somewhere&mdash;you
have simply learned that there are certain things that it is not
proper to say.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">14</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And that&rsquo;s a
large part of education, in fact: just internalizing the
understanding that there are certain things it is not proper to say,
and it is not proper to think. And if you don&rsquo;t learn that,
typically you&rsquo;ll be weeded out of the institutions somewhere
along the line. Well, those two factors are very important ones, and
there are others, but they go a long way towards explaining the
uniformity of ideology in the intellectual culture here. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">15</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, of course, it&rsquo;s
not a hundred percent&mdash;so you&rsquo;ll get a few people
filtering through who will do things differently. Like I say, in this
&ldquo;United in Joy&rdquo; business, I was able to find two people
in the United States who were not &ldquo;United in Joy,&rdquo; and
were able to say so in the mainstream press. But if the system is
really working well, it&rsquo;s not going to do things which
undermine itself. In fact, it&rsquo;s a bit like asking, &ldquo;How
come <i>Pravda</i> under Stalin didn&rsquo;t have journalists
denouncing the Gulags [Soviet penal labor camps]?&rdquo; Why not?
Well, it would have been dysfunctional to the system. I suspect it&rsquo;s
not that the journalists in <i>Pravda</i> were <i>lying</i>&mdash;I
mean, that was a different system, they used the threat of force to
silence dissidents, which we don&rsquo;t use much here. But even in
the Soviet Union, chances are very strong that if you actually
bothered to look, you&rsquo;d find that most of the journalists
actually believed the things they wrote. And that&rsquo;s because
people who <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> believe that kind of thing would never
have made it onto <i>Pravda</i> in the first place. It&rsquo;s very
hard to live with cognitive dissonance: only a real cynic can believe
one thing and say another. So whether it&rsquo;s a totalitarian
system or a free system, the people who are most useful to the system
of power are the ones who actually believe what they say, and they&rsquo;re
the ones who will typically make it through.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So take Tom Wicker
at the <i>New York Times</i>: when you talk to him about this kind of
stuff, he gets very irate and says, &ldquo;Nobody tells <i>me</i>
what to write.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s perfectly true, nobody tells
<i>him</i> what to write&mdash;but if he didn&rsquo;t already <i>know</i>
what to write, he wouldn&rsquo;t be a columnist for the <i>New York
Times.</i> Like, nobody tells Alex Cockburn what to write, and
therefore he&rsquo;s <i>not</i> a columnist for the <i>New York
Times</i>, because he thinks different things. You think the wrong
thoughts, you&rsquo;re not in the system.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it&rsquo;s
interesting that the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> allows this one
opening, Alex Cockburn. I mean, the opening is so minuscule that it&rsquo;s
not even worth discussing&mdash;but it so happens that once a month,
there is one mainstream journal in the United States which allows a
real dissident to write a free and open column. So that means, like,
.0001 percent of the coverage is free and independent. And it&rsquo;s
in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, which doesn&rsquo;t care: for
their audience the <i>New York Times</i> is Communist, so here&rsquo;s
a guy who&rsquo;s even more Communist.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the result of
all of this is that it&rsquo;s a very effective system of ideological
control&mdash;much more effective than Soviet totalitarianism ever
was. In fact, if you look at the entire range of media in the Soviet
Union that people were actually exposed to, they had much more
dissidence in the 1980s than we do, overtly, and people were in fact
reading a much broader range of press, listening to foreign
broadcasts, and so on&mdash;which is pretty much unheard of in the
U.S.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">16</font></sup> Or
just to give one other example, during the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, there was even a newscaster [Vladimir Danchev] who made
broadcasts over Moscow radio for five successive nights back in 1983,
denouncing the Russian invasion of Afghanistan&mdash;he actually
called it an &ldquo;invasion&rdquo;&mdash;and calling on the Afghans
to resist, before he was finally taken off the air.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">17</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s <i>unimaginable</i> in the United States. I mean, can
you imagine Dan Rather or anybody else getting on the radio and
denouncing the U.S. &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; of South Vietnam, and
calling on the Vietnamese to resist? That&rsquo;s inconceivable. The
United States couldn&rsquo;t <i>have</i> that amount of intellectual
freedom.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Well, I

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sure it is. It&rsquo;s
intellectual freedom when a journalist can understand that 2 + 2 = 4;
that&rsquo;s what Orwell was writing about in <i>1984.</i> Everybody
here applauds that book, but nobody is willing to think about what it
means. What Winston Smith [the main character] was saying is, if we
can still understand that 2 + 2 = 4, they haven&rsquo;t taken
everything away. Okay? Well, in the United States, people can&rsquo;t
even understand that 2 + 2 = 4.</p>

really not my point: obviously in any complex institution, there are
going to be a fair number of people who want to do their work with
integrity, and are good at it, and don&rsquo;t just end up serving
power&mdash;these systems aren&rsquo;t totally monolithic, after all.
A lot of people go into journalism  with a real commitment to
professional integrity&mdash;they like the field, and they want to do
it honestly. And some of them continue to do an admirable job of
it&mdash;in fact, some of them even manage to do it at journals like
the <i>New York Times.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, to a large
degree I think you can tell when the <i>New York Times</i>&rsquo;s
editors want a story covered accurately just by looking at who they
send to the place. For instance, when they send John Kifner, that
means they want the story told&mdash;because he&rsquo;s an honest
journalist, and he&rsquo;s going to tell the story. I mean, I don&rsquo;t
know him personally, but you can just tell from his work that he&rsquo;s
a journalist of real integrity, and he&rsquo;s going to dig, he&rsquo;s
going to find out the truth, and he&rsquo;s going to write about
it&mdash;and the editors must know that. So I don&rsquo;t know
anything about how they assign stories at the <i>Times</i>, but I&rsquo;m
willing to make a bet that when there&rsquo;s a story the <i>Times</i>&rsquo;s
editors want told, they&rsquo;ll send Kifner, and when his job is
done they&rsquo;ll probably send him back to the &ldquo;Metro&rdquo;
desk or something.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
most of the people at the <i>Times</i> who make it to be
correspondent or editor or whatever tend to be either very obedient
or very cynical. The obedient ones have adapted&mdash;they&rsquo;ve
internalized the values and believe what they&rsquo;re saying,
otherwise they probably wouldn&rsquo;t have made it that far. But
there are also some plain cynics. James LeMoyne at the <i>Times</i>
is a perfect example: James LeMoyne is an absolute crook, he&rsquo;s
one of the most dishonest journalists I&rsquo;ve ever seen. The
dishonesty of his reporting is so extreme, in fact, that it can&rsquo;t
<i>just</i> be indoctrination in his case. Actually, LeMoyne&rsquo;s
tenure as a correspondent in Central America ended up with an
exposure so bad that even the <i>Times</i> had to publish an
admission about it. Did you follow that?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In 1988 LeMoyne had
written a story which talked about two people in El Salvador who he
claimed were tortured by left-wing guerrillas trying to undermine the
elections; it was one part of a whole effort in the American press at
the time to maintain support for the U.S. client regime in El
Salvador despite its atrocities.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">19</font></sup>
Well, a freelance journalist in Central America, Chris Norton, saw
LeMoyne&rsquo;s article and was surprised by it, because the
atrocities LeMoyne described were supposed to have taken place in an
area of the country reporters couldn&rsquo;t get to, because it was
under military occupation. Norton wanted to figure out just how
LeMoyne knew about these people being tortured, so he went up as
close to that region as he could, and he talked to the mayor, and to
the priest, and to people in the community&mdash;and he discovered
that one of the alleged victims didn&rsquo;t exist, and the other was
perfectly fine. He then went back to San Salvador and did some more
checking&mdash;and he discovered that LeMoyne had simply taken the
story straight from a San Salvadoran newspaper, where it had been
attributed to an army officer. It was in fact just straight army
disinformation of a standard sort, which LeMoyne then reported in the
<i>New York Times</i> as if he knew something about it. Then the
State Department picked it up from the <i>New York Times</i> and
distributed it to Congress to show that the Salvadoran guerrillas
were undermining the election.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, Norton
uncovered this, then another freelance journalist, Mark Cooper,
picked up Norton&rsquo;s story and published something about it in
the <i>L.A. Weekly,</i> an alternative weekly in Los Angeles. The
piece then appeared in the Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting
journal, <i>Extra!</i>&mdash;F.A.I.R. is a very good media analysis
group in New York. Still no reaction from the <i>Times.</i> Finally,
Alex Cockburn got ahold of it, and mentioned it in his column in <i>The
Nation.</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">20</font></sup>
Well, by that time word was sort of getting around about this, so the
<i>Times</i> figured they had to react, and they published a
correction&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s the longest correction they&rsquo;ve
ever published, it&rsquo;s several paragraphs long. It said, our
usual high standards were not met in this case, one thing or another
like that.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">21</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
kind of an extreme example&mdash;but it&rsquo;s by no means the only
case like that. In fact, just let me mention one other one, which was
even more important&mdash;here LeMoyne really plied his trade.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8590_2032848809"></a>Journalism
LeMoyne-Style: A Sample of the Cynical Aspect<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As you know, for
years it was necessary for the U.S. government to maintain the
pretense that the contras in Nicaragua were a guerrilla force, not a
U.S. proxy army. Now, it&rsquo;s perfectly obvious that they were <i>not</i>
a guerrilla force&mdash;there are no guerrillas in history that have
had anything remotely like the degree of support we gave the contras:
there are no guerrillas in history that had three supply flights a
day bringing them food and supplies and weapons, and who complained
that they didn&rsquo;t have enough airplanes, and that they needed
more helicopters. I mean, the whole thing was completely ridiculous:
these guys had armaments that some units of the American army didn&rsquo;t
have, they had computer centers, they had communications equipment.
And they needed all of that, because Nicaragua was under constant
surveillance by high-performance American reconnaissance aircraft to
determine where Sandinista troops were being deployed, and the
contras had to have some way of receiving that information. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">22</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is, it
was necessary for the propaganda system to pretend that the contras
were like the F.M.L.N. in El Salvador&mdash;just a regular indigenous
guerrilla force opposing the government. And part of the method for
claiming that these two forces were equivalent was to say that the
F.M.L.N. guerrillas also had outside support from a foreign
government&mdash;in other words, from the government of Nicaragua&mdash;and
that was the only reason they could survive. Well, it&rsquo;s
<i>conceivable</i> that the F.M.L.N. was getting outside support, but
if so, it would have been some kind of a miracle&mdash;because it was
undetectable. I mean, it&rsquo;s not that the United States is a
primitive, stone-age society: there are technological means around to
discover evidence of such things, but they never were able to detect
any support coming from Nicaragua at all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">According to the
State Department propaganda, the main arms flow  from Nicaragua to
the F.M.L.N. was across the Gulf of Fonseca.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">23</font></sup>
Well, David MacMichael, who was the C.I.A. analyst in charge of
analyzing this material in the early 1980s and then quit the Agency,
testified at the World Court and pointed out what this meant. He
described the situation: the Gulf of Fonseca is thirty kilometers
wide; it&rsquo;s completely patrolled by the U.S. Navy; there&rsquo;s
an island in the middle of it which had a super-sophisticated U.S.
radar system that could pick up boats up and down the Pacific Coast;
there were U.S. Navy S.E.A.L. teams running all around the place&mdash;yet
they never even picked up a canoe. So if Nicaragua were sending arms
across the Gulf of Fonseca, they had to have had some
super-sophisticated methods.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">24</font></sup>
I mean, the <i>Nicaraguans</i> had no problem whatsoever detecting
the U.S. arms flow to the contras&mdash;they told reporters exactly
where it was coming from; it was unreported in the United States,
because the reporters chose not to report it, but the Nicaraguans had
no problem detecting it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">25</font></sup>
Anyway, that was the propaganda line that had to be maintained in the
American press, that was the official story. Now we come back to
James LeMoyne.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The United States
government opposed the Central American peace accords that were
signed in 1987 [Esquipulas II, the so-called &ldquo;Arias plan&rdquo;],
so it was therefore necessary to demolish them. And one of the ways
of demolishing them was to increase aid to the contras. The press
committed itself with great passion to helping this effort along;
LeMoyne was right up front. Right after the accords were signed,
LeMoyne published an article in which he wrote: there is &ldquo;ample
evidence&rdquo; that the Salvadoran guerrillas are being supplied
with arms by Nicaragua in violation of the peace accords, and without
that support the guerrillas couldn&rsquo;t survive.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">26</font></sup>
Alright, that had always been the necessary story, but just then it
was especially important to drive it home&mdash;because right then
the United States was tripling its supply flights to the contras in
response to the accords, and of course in violation of the accords.
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">27</font></sup> So the
press wouldn&rsquo;t report that we were escalating our support for
the contras, but they kept reporting that the Nicaraguans were
illegally arming the F.M.L.N. in El Salvador&mdash;and now James
LeMoyne says that there is &ldquo;ample evidence&rdquo; of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, when that
story appeared, F.A.I.R. wrote a letter to the <i>New York Times</i>,
asking them to please have James LeMoyne enlighten their readers
about the &ldquo;ample evidence&rdquo; of this arms flow to the
F.M.L.N.&mdash;since the World Court couldn&rsquo;t find it, and no
independent investigator&rsquo;s been able to find it, and the guys
who worked on it in the C.I.A. didn&rsquo;t know about it: could they
please do that? Well, the <i>Times</i> didn&rsquo;t publish their
letter, but F.A.I.R. did get a personal response back from the
Foreign Editor, Joseph Lelyveld, who said, yes, maybe LeMoyne&rsquo;s
report was a bit imprecise this time, it didn&rsquo;t meet his usual
high standards, and so on. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">28</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Then followed a
period in which the <i>Times</i> had plenty of time to correct the
&ldquo;imprecision&rdquo;&mdash;but instead article after article
appeared by LeMoyne, George Volsky, Steven Engelberg and others,
repeating exactly the same  falsehood: that there was ample evidence
of an arms flow from Nicaragua.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">29</font></sup>
But F.A.I.R. just kept after them, and finally they got another
letter back from Lelyveld, the Foreign Editor&mdash;this was around
March now, their first letter was in August. Lelyveld said he had
recently assigned LeMoyne to do a major story on the arms flow to the
F.M.L.N., to really nail the thing down once and for all, and that
they should wait for that story. Okay, they waited. Nothing happened.
Six months later, they figured nothing was <i>going</i> to happen, so
they published this interchange of letters with Lelyveld in the
F.A.I.R. newsletter, and said: we don&rsquo;t see the story, what&rsquo;s
going on?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">30</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Two months after
that, a story did finally appear in the <i>Times</i>&mdash;I think it
was LeMoyne&rsquo;s last story before he left the <i>Times</i>, or
whatever he did, took a leave or something. This is now fifteen
months after his original story about the &ldquo;ample evidence,&rdquo;
nine months after he was assigned to do the follow-up. And if you
take a look at the article the <i>Times</i> finally published, you&rsquo;ll
discover that the &ldquo;ample evidence&rdquo; had turned into <i>no</i>
evidence. LeMoyne said: well, there really is no direct evidence of
any supply of arms from Nicaragua; some people say this, some people
say that, but there&rsquo;s nothing concrete, there&rsquo;s nothing
to point to. So that&rsquo;s the end of the story: it turns out the
&ldquo;ample evidence&rdquo; is no evidence.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">31</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, that&rsquo;s no
joke&mdash;this is fabrication in the service of the state that has
led to tens of thousands of people being killed, because maintaining
this pretense over the years has been one of the ways in which the
U.S. government has supported the terror in El Salvador and extended
the war against Nicaragua. It&rsquo;s not a small point. This is
serious lying, very serious. And it&rsquo;s just one of thousands of
cases demonstrating that the media in the United States serve the
interests of state-corporate power, they are organs of propaganda, as
in fact one would expect them to be.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">32</font></sup></p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8592_2032848809"></a>Rethinking
Watergate<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But how do
you explain Watergate, then? Those reporters weren&rsquo;t very
sympathetic to power&mdash;they toppled a President.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And just ask
yourself <i>why</i> he was toppled&mdash;he was toppled because he
had made a very bad mistake: he had antagonized people with power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, one of the
serious illusions we live under in the United States, which is a
major part of the whole system of indoctrination, is the idea that
the <i>government</i> is the power&mdash;and the government&rsquo;s
<i>not</i> the power, the government is one segment of power. Real
power is in the hands of the people who own the society; the
state-managers are usually just servants. And Watergate is actually a
perfect illustration of the point&mdash;because right at the time of
Watergate, history actually ran a controlled experiment for us. The
Watergate exposures, it turns out, came at exactly the same time as
the COINTELPRO exposures&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if you know what I
mean.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: COINTELPRO?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, you probably
don&rsquo;t&mdash;but that already makes my point, because the
COINTELPRO exposures were a thousand times more significant than
Watergate. Remember what Watergate <i>was</i>, after all: Watergate
was a matter of a bunch of guys from the Republican National
Committee breaking into a Democratic Party office for essentially
unknown reasons and doing no damage. Okay, that&rsquo;s petty
burglary, it&rsquo;s not a big deal. Well, at the exact same time
that Watergate was discovered, there were exposures in the courts and
through the Freedom of Information Act of massive F.B.I. operations
to undermine political freedom in the United States, running through
every administration back to Roosevelt, but really picking up under
Kennedy. It was called &ldquo;COINTELPRO&rdquo; [short for
&ldquo;Counterintelligence Program&rdquo;], and it included a vast
range of things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It included the
straight Gestapo-style assassination of a Black Panther leader; it
included organizing race riots in an effort to destroy the black
movements; it included attacks on the American Indian Movement, on
the women&rsquo;s movement, you name it. It included fifteen years of
F.B.I. disruption of the Socialist Workers Party&mdash;that meant
regular F.B.I. burglaries, stealing membership lists and using them
to threaten people, going to businesses and getting members fired
from their jobs, and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">33</font></sup>
Well, that fact alone&mdash;the fact that for fifteen years the
F.B.I. had been burglarizing and trying to undermine a legal
political party&mdash;is already vastly more important than the fact
that a bunch of Keystone Kops broke into the Democratic National
Committee headquarters one time. The Socialist Workers Party is a
legal political party, after all&mdash;the fact that they&rsquo;re a
<i>weak</i> political party doesn&rsquo;t mean they have less rights
than the Democrats. And this wasn&rsquo;t a bunch of gangsters, this
was the national political police: that&rsquo;s very serious. And it
didn&rsquo;t happen once in the Watergate office complex, it was
going on for fifteen years, under every administration. And keep in
mind, the Socialist Workers Party episode is just some tiny footnote
to COINTELPRO. In comparison to this, Watergate is a tea party.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, look at the
comparison in treatment&mdash;I mean, you&rsquo;re aware of the
comparison in treatment, that&rsquo;s why you know about Watergate
and you don&rsquo;t know about COINTELPRO. So what does that tell
you? What it tells you is, people in power will defend themselves.
The Democratic Party represents about half of corporate power, and
those people are able to defend themselves; the Socialist Workers
Party represents no power, the Black Panthers don&rsquo;t represent
any power, the American Indian Movement doesn&rsquo;t represent any
power&mdash;so you can do anything you want to them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take a look at
the Nixon administration&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;Enemies List,&rdquo;
which came out in the course of Watergate [exposed in 1973, the
document named 208 Americans from various professions under the title
&ldquo;Opponents list and political enemies project&rdquo;]. You&rsquo;ve
heard of that, but did you hear about the assassination of Fred
Hampton? No. Nothing ever happened to any of the people who were on
the Enemies List, which I know perfectly  well, because I was on
it&mdash;and it wasn&rsquo;t because <i>I</i> was on it that it made
the front pages. But the F.B.I. and the Chicago police <i>assassinated</i>
a Black Panther leader as he lay in his bed one night during the
Nixon administration [on December 4, 1969]. Well, if the press had
any integrity at all, if the <i>Washington Post</i> had any
integrity, what they would have said is, &ldquo;Watergate is totally
insignificant and innocuous, who cares about any of that in
comparison with these other things.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s not what
happened, obviously. And that just shows again, very dramatically,
how the press is lined up with power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The real lesson of
Nixon&rsquo;s fall is that the President shouldn&rsquo;t call Thomas
Watson [Chairman of I.B.M.] and McGeorge Bundy [former Democratic
official] bad names&mdash;that means the Republic&rsquo;s collapsing.
And the press prides itself on having exposed this fact. On the other
hand, if you want to send the F.B.I. to organize the assassination of
a Black Panther leader, that&rsquo;s fine by us; it&rsquo;s fine by
the <i>Washington Post</i> too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Incidentally, I
think there is another reason why a lot of powerful people were out
to get Nixon at that time&mdash;and it had to do with something a lot
more profound than the Enemies List and the Watergate burglary. I
suspect it had to do with the events of the summer of 1971, when the
Nixon administration basically broke up the international economic
arrangement that had existed for the previous twenty-five years [i.e.
the so-called &ldquo;Bretton Woods&rdquo; system, established in 1944
at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton
Woods, New Hampshire]. See, by 1971 the Vietnam War had already badly
weakened the United States economically relative to its industrial
rivals, and one of the ways the Nixon administration reacted to that
was by simply tearing apart the Bretton Woods system, which had been
set up to organize the world economy after World War II. The Bretton
Woods system had made the United States the world&rsquo;s banker,
basically&mdash;it had established the U.S. dollar as a global
reserve currency fixed to gold, and it imposed conditions about no
import quotas, and so on. And Nixon just tore the whole thing to
shreds: he went off the gold standard, he stopped the convertibility
of the dollar, he raised import duties. No other country would have
had the power to do that, but Nixon did it, and that made him a lot
of powerful enemies&mdash;because multinational corporations and
international banks relied on that system, and they did not like it
being broken down. So if you look back, you&rsquo;ll find that Nixon
was being attacked in places like the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> at
the time, and I suspect that from that point on there were plenty of
powerful people out to get him. Watergate just offered an
opportunity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, in this
respect I think Nixon was treated extremely unfairly. I mean, there
were real crimes of the Nixon administration, and he should have been
tried&mdash;but not for any of the Watergate business. Take the
bombing of Cambodia, for instance: the bombing of Cambodia was
<i>infinitely</i> worse than anything that came up in the Watergate
hearings&mdash;this thing they call the &ldquo;secret bombing&rdquo;
of Cambodia, which was &ldquo;secret&rdquo; because the press didn&rsquo;t
talk about what they knew.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">34</font></sup>
The U.S. killed maybe a couple  hundred thousand people in Cambodia,
they devastated a peasant society. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">35</font></sup>
The bombing of Cambodia did not even appear in Nixon&rsquo;s Articles
of Impeachment. It was raised in the Senate hearings, but only in one
interesting respect&mdash;the question that was raised was, why
hadn&rsquo;t Nixon informed Congress? It wasn&rsquo;t, why did you
carry out one of the most intense bombings in history in densely
populated areas of a peasant country, killing maybe 150,000 people?
That never came up. The only question was, why didn&rsquo;t you tell
Congress? In other words, were people with power granted their
prerogatives? And once again, notice that what it means is,
infringing on the rights of powerful people is unacceptable: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
powerful, so you&rsquo;ve got to tell us&mdash;then we&rsquo;ll tell
you, &lsquo;Fine, go bomb Cambodia.&rsquo; &rdquo; In fact, that
whole thing was a gag&mdash;because there was no reason for Congress
not to have known about the bombing, just as there was no reason for
the media not to have known: it was completely public.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So in terms of all
the horrifying atrocities the Nixon government carried out, Watergate
isn&rsquo;t even worth laughing about. It was a triviality. Watergate
is a very clear example of what happens to servants when they forget
their role and go after the people who own the place: they are very
quickly put back into their box, and somebody else takes over. You
couldn&rsquo;t ask for a better illustration of it than that&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s even more dramatic because <i>this</i> is the great
exposure that&rsquo;s supposed to demonstrate what a free and
critical press we have. What Watergate really shows is what a
submissive and obedient press we have, as the comparisons to
COINTELPRO and Cambodia illustrate very clearly.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s largely
true&mdash;but like I say, there&rsquo;s a lot of flexibility
possible. I mean, it&rsquo;s true that the ideological barrier in the
U.S. media is extreme&mdash;other countries have more openings for
dissidence in the mainstream than we do, even though their economic
systems are basically the same. But still there is quite a range of
possibility for opening up the press here, even as it now stands: it
doesn&rsquo;t have to be .0001 percent open to dissident
perspectives, it could be .1 percent or something. So I actually
think there are plenty of changes possible in the United States, even
from within the institutions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember that the
media have two basic functions. One is to indoctrinate the elites, to
make sure they have the right ideas and know how to serve power. In
fact, typically the elites are the <i>most</i> indoctrinated segment
of a society, because they are the ones who are exposed to the most
propaganda and actually take part in the decision-making process. For
them you have the <i>New York Times,</i> and the <i>Washington Post,</i>
and the <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> and so on. But there&rsquo;s also
a mass media, whose main function is just to get rid of the rest of
the population&mdash;to marginalize and eliminate them, so they don&rsquo;t
interfere with decision-making. And the press that&rsquo;s designed
for that purpose isn&rsquo;t the <i>New York Times</i> and the
<i>Washington Post,</i> it&rsquo;s sitcoms on television, and the
<i>National Enquirer,</i> and sex and violence, and babies with three
heads, and football, all that kind of stuff. But the approximately 85
percent of the population that is the main target of that media, they
don&rsquo;t have it in their <i>genes</i> that they&rsquo;re not
interested in the way the world works. And if they can escape from
the effects of the de-education  and indoctrination system, and the
whole class system it&rsquo;s a part of&mdash;it&rsquo;s after all
not <i>just</i> indoctrination that keeps people from getting
involved in political life, by any means&mdash;if they can do that,
then yeah, they&rsquo;re a big audience for an alternative, and
there&rsquo;s some hope.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, there&rsquo;s
a very interesting history about this in England. For a long time in
England, there was a mass, popular, daily labor press of quite good
newspapers, with a huge readership&mdash;a much bigger readership
than all the elite press in England combined, actually. It was the
<i>Daily Herald</i> and the <i>News Chronicle</i> and the <i>Sunday
Citizen.</i> And this was not just Alex Cockburn once a month in the
<i>Wall Street Journal</i>, but <i>every day</i> there were
newspapers giving a picture of the world and expressing a set of
values radically different from those of the business community. And
not only did they have a big circulation, but their audience was also
very much involved&mdash;for instance, there were surveys showing
that people actually <i>read</i> those newspapers much more than
subscribers to things like the <i>Guardian</i> and the <i>London
Times.</i> But they disappeared in the 1960s, and they disappeared
due to market pressures&mdash;it didn&rsquo;t have anything to do
with the number of readers they had, it had to do with the amount of
capital they could attract. Could you get advertisers, could you get
capital for investment? In short, could you appeal to the business
community, which happens to hold the real power? And over time, they
couldn&rsquo;t.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">36</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s the same
thing here: for instance, in the United States there isn&rsquo;t even
any such thing as a &ldquo;labor reporter&rdquo; anymore (except in
the business press, actually)&mdash;but there are plenty of &ldquo;business
reporters.&rdquo; And again, that doesn&rsquo;t reflect <i>people&rsquo;s</i>
interests: a lot more people are interested in the problems of
workers than are interested in the bond market, if you count their
numbers&mdash;but if you multiply their numbers by their power in the
society, then yeah, it&rsquo;s true, the market for news about money
and stocks is much greater than the market for news about issues
which matter to working people.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But that&rsquo;s
just the fact about an inegalitarian system: when you have a serious
disproportion of power, independent forces are likely to
collapse&mdash;just because they can&rsquo;t get access to enough
capital in the end. Like in England, some media corporation didn&rsquo;t
come along and try to offer this huge mass audience another paper
with a social-democratic line. Business doesn&rsquo;t work that
way&mdash;it&rsquo;s not trying to educate people to overthrow it,
even if you could make a profit off it. I mean, if you could convince
Rupert Murdoch that he can make a ton of money by publishing a
newspaper which has a social-democratic or even more radical line,
something calling for workers&rsquo; management of corporations for
instance, he wouldn&rsquo;t do it&mdash;because there are some things
that are more important than profits, like maintaining the entire
system of power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, this is
also pretty much the same reason why American elites want military
spending instead of social spending: if it turned out, as is likely,
that using taxpayers&rsquo; money for socially useful purposes was
even  more profitable than sending it through the military system,
that still wouldn&rsquo;t change the decision to prefer military
spending&mdash;because social spending is going to interfere with the
basic prerogatives of power, it&rsquo;s going to organize popular
constituencies, and have all these other negative side effects that
you want to avoid.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: So what
you&rsquo;re saying is, even if there were a major cultural change,
with people at the grassroots level actually demanding a much more
open press, there still wouldn&rsquo;t be the capital to support that
press?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, people would
have to take control of that capital. I mean, for one thing, if there
really were a mass of people demanding that kind of press, they would
<i>have</i> the capital&mdash;not at the level of big corporations,
but like unions, say. When unions are a mass organization, they can
accumulate strike funds, even though they can&rsquo;t compete with
management and ownership in terms of total resources. But for another
thing, there&rsquo;s no law of nature which says that control over
capital has to be in a few hands&mdash;that&rsquo;s like saying that
political power has to be in a few hands. Why? There wasn&rsquo;t a
law that said that the king and the nobles had to run everything, and
there isn&rsquo;t a law that says that corporate owners and managers
have to run everything either. These are social arrangements. They
developed historically, they can be changed historically.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8596_2032848809"></a>Understanding
the Middle East Conflict<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: If I can
just change the topic a little, Professor&mdash;I&rsquo;d like you to
talk a bit about the situation in the Middle East these days. People
say the Palestinians are utilizing the media more than they ever have
before to draw attention to Israeli repression [i.e. during the
Palestinian uprising of the late 1980s]. I&rsquo;m wondering whether
you think that will have any effect on Israel&rsquo;s occupation of
the Palestinian territories on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in
the future?</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.15in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 0.28in">
<i>[Editors&rsquo; Note: The following discussion of the
Israeli/Palestinian conflict forms the foundation of Chomsky&rsquo;s
analysis of the so-called &ldquo;peace process&rdquo; that began in
the early 1990s, which is discussed in chapters 5 and 8.]</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, this business
about the Palestinians &ldquo;using the media&rdquo; is mostly racist
garbage, in my view. The fact of the matter is that the Intifada is a
big, mass, popular revolution in reaction to the absolutely brutal
treatment the Palestinians have been living under&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
going on in places where there are no television cameras, and places
where there are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, there&rsquo;s a
whole racist line which is very common in the United  States. One of
my favorite versions of it appeared in the journal <i>Commentary,</i>
in an article written by some professor in Canada. It said: the
Palestinians are &ldquo;people who breed, and bleed, and advertise
their misery.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">37</font></sup>
Straight Nazi propaganda. I mean, imagine if somebody said that about
Jews: &ldquo;Jews are people who breed, and bleed, and advertise
their misery.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s the kind of thing you hear&mdash;it&rsquo;s
a particularly vulgar version of it, but the line is: look, the
Palestinians are just doing it for the cameras because they&rsquo;re
trying to discredit the Jews.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They do exactly the
same thing when there are no cameras.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The real point is,
Israel is having a lot of trouble putting down this popular
revolution. I mean, the repression of the Palestinians in the West
Bank is not qualitatively different right now from what it&rsquo;s
been for the last twenty years&mdash;it&rsquo;s just that it&rsquo;s
escalated in scale since the Palestinians started fighting back in
the Intifada. So the brutality you see occasionally now on television
has in fact been going on for the last twenty years, and it&rsquo;s
just the nature of a military occupation: military occupations are
harsh and brutal, there is no other kind [Israel seized the West
Bank, Gaza Strip, and Golan Heights from Jordan, Egypt, and Syria
during the Six Day War in 1967, and has controlled them ever since].
There&rsquo;s been home-destruction, collective punishments,
expulsion, plenty of humiliation, censorship&mdash;I mean, you&rsquo;d
have to go back to the worst days of the American South to know what
it&rsquo;s been like for the Palestinians in the Occupied
Territories. They are not supposed to raise their heads&mdash;that&rsquo;s
what they say in Israel, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re raising their heads,
we&rsquo;ve got to do something about it.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s the
way the Palestinians have been living. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">38</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the United
States has been quite happy supporting that&mdash;so long as it
worked. But in the last few years, it hasn&rsquo;t worked. See,
people with power understand exactly one thing: violence. If violence
is effective, everything&rsquo;s okay; but if violence loses its
effectiveness, then they start worrying and have to try something
else. So right now you can see U.S. planners reassessing their
policies towards the Occupied Territories, just as you can see the
Israeli leadership reassessing them&mdash;because violence isn&rsquo;t
working as well anymore. In fact, the occupation&rsquo;s beginning to
be rather harmful for Israel. So it&rsquo;s entirely possible that
there could be some tactical changes coming with respect to how
Israel goes about controlling the Territories&mdash;but none of this
has anything to do with &ldquo;using the media.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: What do
you think a solution might be for resolving the conflict in the
region, then?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, outside of the
United States, everybody would know the answer to that question. I
mean, for years there&rsquo;s been a very broad consensus in the
world over the basic framework of a solution in the Middle East, with
the exception of two countries: the United States and Israel.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">39</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s going to have to be some variety of two-state settlement.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, there are two
groups claiming the right of national self-determination in the same
territory; they both have a claim, they&rsquo;re competing claims.
There are various ways in which such competing claims could be
reconciled&mdash;you could do it through a federation, one thing or
another&mdash;but given the present state of conflict, it&rsquo;s
just going to have to be done through some form of two-state
settlement.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">40</font></sup>
Now, you could talk about the modalities&mdash;should it be a
confederation, how do you deal with economic integration, and so
on&mdash;but the principle&rsquo;s quite clear: there has to be some
settlement that recognizes the right of self-determination of Jews in
something like the state of Israel, and the right of
self-determination of Palestinians in something like a Palestinian
state. And everybody knows where that Palestinian state would be&mdash;in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, along roughly the borders that existed
before the Six Day War in 1967. And everybody knows who the
representative of the Palestinians is: it&rsquo;s the Palestine
Liberation Organization [P.L.O.].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">All of this has been
obvious for years&mdash;why hasn&rsquo;t it happened? Well, of course
Israel&rsquo;s opposed to it. But the main reason it hasn&rsquo;t
happened is because the United States has blocked it: the United
States has been blocking the peace process in the Middle East for the
last twenty years&mdash;<i>we&rsquo;re</i> the leaders of the
rejectionist camp, not the Arabs or anybody else. See, the United
States supports a policy which Henry Kissinger called &ldquo;stalemate&rdquo;;
that was his word for it back in 1970.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">41</font></sup>
At that time, there was kind of a split in the American government as
to whether we should <i>join</i> the broad international consensus on
a political settlement, or <i>block</i> a political settlement. And
in that internal struggle, the hard-liners prevailed; Kissinger was
the main spokesman. The policy that won out was what he called
&ldquo;stalemate&rdquo;: keep things the way they are, maintain the
system of Israeli oppression. And there was a good reason for that,
it wasn&rsquo;t just out of the blue: having an embattled,
militaristic Israel is an important part of how we rule the world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Basically the United
States doesn&rsquo;t give a damn about Israel: if it goes down the
drain, U.S. planners don&rsquo;t care one way or another, there&rsquo;s
no moral obligation or anything else. But what they <i>do</i> care
about is control of the enormous oil resources of the Middle East. I
mean, a big part of the way you run the planet is by controlling
Middle East oil, and in the late 1950s, the United States began to
recognize that Israel would be a very useful ally in this respect. So
for example, there&rsquo;s a National Security Council Memorandum in
1958 which points out that the main enemy of the United States in the
Middle East (as everywhere) is nationalism, what they call &ldquo;radical
Arab nationalism&rdquo;&mdash;which means independence, countries
pursuing a course other than submission to the needs of American
power. Well, that&rsquo;s always the enemy: the people there don&rsquo;t
always see why the enormous wealth and resources of the region have
to be in the control of American and British investors while they
starve, they&rsquo;ve never really gotten that into their heads&mdash;and
sometimes they try to do something about it. Alright,  that&rsquo;s
unacceptable to the United States, and one of the things they pointed
out is that a useful weapon against that sort of &ldquo;radical Arab
nationalism&rdquo; would be a highly militarized Israel, which would
then be a reliable base for U.S. power in the region. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">42</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, that insight
was not really acted upon extensively until the Six Day War in 1967,
when, with U.S. support, Israel essentially destroyed Nasser [the
Egyptian President]&mdash;who was regarded as the main Arab
nationalist force in the Middle East&mdash;and virtually all the
other Arab armies in the region too. That won Israel a lot of points,
it established them as what&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;strategic
asset&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a military force that can be used as an
outlet for U.S. power. In fact, at the time, Israel and Iran under
the Shah (which were allies, tacit allies) came to be regarded by
American planners as two parts of a tripartite U.S. system for
controlling the Middle East. This consisted first of all of Saudi
Arabia, which is where most of the oil is, and then its two
gendarmes, pre-revolutionary Iran and Israel&mdash;the &ldquo;Guardians
of the Gulf,&rdquo; as they were called, who were supposed to protect
Saudi Arabia from indigenous nationalist forces in the area. Of
course, when the Shah fell in the Iranian Revolution in 1979,
Israel&rsquo;s role became even more important to the United States,
it was the last &ldquo;Guardian.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">43</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Meanwhile, Israel
began to pick up secondary functions: it started to serve as a
mercenary state for the United States around the world. So in the
1960s, Israel started to be used as a conduit for intervening in the
affairs of black African countries, under a big C.I.A. subsidy. And
in the 1970s and Eighties, the United States increasingly turned to
Israel as kind of a weapon against other parts of the Third
World&mdash;Israel would provide armaments and training and computers
and all sorts of other things to Third World dictatorships at times
when it was hard for the U.S. government to give that support
directly. For instance, Israel acted as the main U.S. contact with
the South African military for years, right through the embargo [the
U.N. Security Council imposed a mandatory arms embargo on South
Africa in 1977 after the U.S. and Britain had vetoed even stronger
resolutions].<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">44</font></sup>
Well, that&rsquo;s a very useful alliance, and that&rsquo;s another
reason why Israel gets such extraordinary amounts of U.S. aid.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">45</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8598_2032848809"></a>The
Threat of Peace<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But notice that this
whole system only works as long as Israel remains embattled. So
suppose there was a real peace settlement in the Middle East, and
Israel was just integrated into the region as its most
technologically advanced country, kind of like Switzerland or
Luxembourg or something. Well, at that point its value to the United
States is essentially over&mdash;we already have Luxembourg, we don&rsquo;t
need another one. Israel&rsquo;s value to the United States depends
on the fact that it is threatened with destruction: that makes them
completely dependent on the United States for survival, and
therefore extremely reliable&mdash;because if the rug ever is pulled
out from under them in a situation of real conflict, they <i>will</i>
get destroyed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And that reasoning
has held right up to the present. I mean, it&rsquo;s easy to show
that the United States has blocked every move towards a political
settlement that has come along in the Middle East&mdash;often we&rsquo;ve
just vetoed them at the U.N. Security Council.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">46</font></sup>
In fact, up until very recently, it&rsquo;s been impossible in the
United States even to <i>talk</i> about a political settlement. The
official line in the United States has been, &ldquo;The Arabs want to
kill all the Jews and throw them into the sea&rdquo;&mdash;with only
two exceptions. One is King Hussein of Jordan, who&rsquo;s a
&ldquo;moderate,&rdquo; because he&rsquo;s on our side. And the other
was President Sadat of Egypt, who in 1977 realized the error of his
ways, so he flew to Jerusalem and became a man of peace&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s why the Arabs killed him, because the Arabs&rsquo;ll
kill anybody who&rsquo;s for peace [Sadat was assassinated in 1981].
That has been the official line in the United States, and you simply
cannot deviate from it in the press or scholarship.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s total
lies from beginning to end. Take Sadat: Sadat made a peace offer to
Israel in February 1971, a better offer from Israel&rsquo;s point of
view than the one he later initiated in 1977 [which led to the Camp
David peace talks]. It was a full peace treaty exactly in accord with
U.N. Resolution 242 [which had called for a return to pre-June 1967
borders in the region with security guarantees, but made no mention
of Palestinian rights]&mdash;the United States and Israel turned it
down, therefore it&rsquo;s out of history. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">47</font></sup>
In January 1976, Syria, Jordan and Egypt proposed a two-state peace
settlement at the U.N. Security Council on the basis of U.N. 242, and
the P.L.O. supported the proposal&mdash;it called for territorial
guarantees, the whole business: the United States vetoed it, so it&rsquo;s
out of history, it didn&rsquo;t happen. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">48</font></sup>
And it just goes on from there: the United States was unwilling to
support any of these peace offers, so they&rsquo;re out of history,
they&rsquo;re down Orwell&rsquo;s memory hole.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">49</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, it&rsquo;s
even at the point where journals in the United States will not permit
<i>letters</i> referring to these proposals; the degree of control on
this is startling, actually. For example, a few years ago George Will
wrote a column in <i>Newsweek</i> called &ldquo;Mideast Truth and
Falsehood,&rdquo; about how peace activists are lying about the
Middle East, everything they say is a lie. And in the article, there
was one statement that had a vague relation to fact: he said that
Sadat had refused to deal with Israel until 1977.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">50</font></sup>
So I wrote them a letter, the kind of letter you write to
<i>Newsweek</i>&mdash;you know, four lines&mdash;in which I said,
&ldquo;Will has one statement of fact, it&rsquo;s false; Sadat made a
peace offer in 1971, and Israel and the United States turned it
down.&rdquo; Well, a couple days later I got a call from a research
editor who checks facts for the <i>Newsweek</i> &ldquo;Letters&rdquo;
column. She said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re kind of interested in your
letter, where did you get those facts?&rdquo; So I told her, &ldquo;Well,
they&rsquo;re published in <i>Newsweek</i>, on February 8,
1971&rdquo;&mdash;which is true, because it was a big proposal, it
just happened to go down the memory hole in the United  States
because it was the wrong story.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">51</font></sup>
So she looked it up and called me back, and said, &ldquo;Yeah, you&rsquo;re
right, we found it there; okay, we&rsquo;ll run your letter.&rdquo;
An hour later she called again and said, &ldquo;Gee, I&rsquo;m sorry,
but we can&rsquo;t run the letter.&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
the problem?&rdquo; She said, &ldquo;Well, the editor mentioned it to
Will and he&rsquo;s having a tantrum; they decided they can&rsquo;t
run it.&rdquo; Well, okay.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is, in
<i>Newsweek</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Washington
Post</i> and so on, you simply cannot state these facts&mdash;it&rsquo;s
like belief in divinity or something, the lies have become immutable
truth.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Then what
happened with the Camp David Accords&mdash;why did the United States
and Israel agree to deal with Egypt at that point?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, if you look
back to around 1971 or so, you&rsquo;ll find that all the American
ambassadors in the Middle East were warning Kissinger that there was
going to be a war if the United States kept blocking every diplomatic
option for resolving the conflict.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">52</font></sup>
Even the big oil companies were in favor of a political settlement,
they were telling the White House: &ldquo;Look, if you block every
diplomatic option, the Arabs are going to go to war, they&rsquo;ve
got no choice.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">53</font></sup>
But in the White House they were just laughing, it was all a big
joke&mdash;just like they were laughing in Israel. And on purely
racist grounds.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, intelligence
systems are very flawed institutions: they&rsquo;re highly
ideological, they&rsquo;re fanatic, they&rsquo;re racist, and as a
result the information that comes through them is usually grossly
distorted. Well, in this case the intelligence information was,
&ldquo;Arabs don&rsquo;t know how to fight.&rdquo; The chief of
Israeli military intelligence, Yehosifat Harkabi, his line was, &ldquo;War
is not the Arab&rsquo;s game&rdquo;&mdash;you know, these gooks don&rsquo;t
know which end of the gun to hold, you don&rsquo;t have to worry
about them. And the American military, the C.I.A., everyone obviously
was producing the same information: if Sadat mobilizes an army in the
Sinai, you kind of laugh, &ldquo;What do these guys think they&rsquo;re
doing? We&rsquo;ll leave seven hundred men on the Bar-Lev Line and
that&rsquo;ll stop them.&rdquo;<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">54</font></sup>
So the United States refused to pursue a diplomatic settlement, and
that refusal then brought on the 1973 war&mdash;where suddenly it
turned out that war <i>was</i> the Arab&rsquo;s game: the Egyptians
won a major victory in the Sinai, it was quite a military operation,
in fact. And it just shocked U.S. and Israeli intelligence, it really
frightened them&mdash;because like I say, state planners usually
understand violence, even if they can&rsquo;t understand anything
else. So in the &rsquo;73 war, it suddenly became clear that the
assumption that &ldquo;war is not the Arab&rsquo;s game&rdquo; was
false: Egypt <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> a military basket-case.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, as long as
Egypt was a basket-case, the United States had been content to let
them be a Russian ally&mdash;if the Russians want to sink money into
this morass, that&rsquo;s fine, we don&rsquo;t mind, we just laugh at
them. But in the 1973 war, it suddenly became clear that Egypt wasn&rsquo;t
just a basket-case,  they knew how to shoot and do all these other
things that matter, so Kissinger decided to accept what had in fact
been long-standing Egyptian offers to become an American
client-state. Well, that&rsquo;s what Egypt had wanted all along, so
they immediately kicked out the Russians and got on the American
gravy-train. And now they&rsquo;re the second-biggest recipient of
U.S. aid, though still way behind Israel&mdash;and at that point
Sadat became a &ldquo;moderate,&rdquo; because he had switched to our
side. And since Egypt was considered the major Arab deterrent to
hawkish Israeli policies, the obvious back-up position was just to
remove them from the conflict, so Israel would be free to solidify
its control in the region&mdash;as it has done, in fact. See, before
the 1973 war, U.S. planners thought that Israel didn&rsquo;t have to
worry about any Arab forces at all. Now they saw that that was
wrong&mdash;so they moved to extract Egypt from the conflict. And
that was the great achievement of the Camp David peace process: it
enabled Israel to integrate the Occupied Territories and attack
Lebanon without any Egyptian deterrent. Alright, try to say <i>that</i>
in the U.S. media.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Incidentally, by now
you are beginning to be able to say it in the strategic analysis
literature. So if you read articles by strategic analysts, they&rsquo;re
starting to say, yeah, that&rsquo;s the way it worked.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">55</font></sup>
Of course that&rsquo;s the way it worked, that&rsquo;s the way it was
<i>designed.</i> That&rsquo;s the way it was obviously going to work
right at the time of Camp David&mdash;I mean, I was writing about
this in 1977.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">56</font></sup>
If you eliminate the major Arab deterrent force and increase U.S. aid
to Israel to the level of 50 percent of total U.S. aid worldwide, and
Israel is committed to integrating the Occupied Territories and
attacking and disrupting Lebanon, if you get that configuration of
events, what do you <i>think</i> is going to happen? It&rsquo;s
transparent, a child could figure it out. But you can&rsquo;t say it,
because to say it would imply that the United States is not the
leader of the world peace forces, and is not interested in justice
and freedom and human rights around the world. Therefore you can&rsquo;t
say any of these things here, and by now you probably can&rsquo;t
even <i>see</i> them.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8600_2032848809"></a>Water
and the Occupied Territories<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But doesn&rsquo;t
Israel need the Occupied Territories for defense purposes, with
respect to the other Arab states on its borders&mdash;isn&rsquo;t
that the main reason for holding on to them?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there I can
only talk about the way that <i>they</i> look at it&mdash;the way the
top Israeli decision-makers look at it. So there&rsquo;s a very
interesting book published in Hebrew, called <i>Mechiro shel lhud</i>,
which is a detailed documentary record of the period from 1967 to
1977, when the Labor Party was in power in Israel [the Occupied
Territories were originally seized by Israel in 1967]. It&rsquo;s by
a guy named Yossi Beilin, who was the top advisor to Shimon Peres and
is kind of a Labor Party dove, and he had access to  all sorts of
Labor Party documents. And the book is almost a daily record of
cabinet meetings in Israel between 1967 and &rsquo;77&mdash;right in
the period when they were trying to figure out just what to do with
the Occupied Territories. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">57</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there&rsquo;s
virtually no mention of security, barely a mention of it. One thing
that does get mentioned a lot is what they call the &ldquo;demographic
problem&rdquo;&mdash;the problem of what do you do about too many
Arabs in a Jewish state. Okay, that&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;demographic
problem&rdquo; in Israel, and in fact, people here refer to it that
way too.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">58</font></sup>
The purpose of that term, which sounds like kind of a neutral
sociological term, is to disguise the fact that it&rsquo;s a deeply
racist notion&mdash;we would see that right off if we applied it
here. Like, suppose some group in New York City started talking about
the &ldquo;demographic problem&rdquo;&mdash;there are too many Jews
and blacks. There are too many Jews and blacks in New York City, and
we&rsquo;ve got to do something about it, because they&rsquo;re
taking over&mdash;so we&rsquo;ve got to deal with the &ldquo;demographic
problem.&rdquo; It wouldn&rsquo;t be very hard to decode this. But in
Israel and in this book of cabinet records, there&rsquo;s a lot of
talk about the &ldquo;demographic problem,&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s easy
to see what that means.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another thing they
talk about a lot is water&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a very crucial
thing, which is not discussed very much in the United States but it&rsquo;s
probably the main reason why Israel is never going to give up the
West Bank. See, this is a very arid region, so water is more
important than oil, and there are very limited water resources in
Israel. In fact, a lot of the wars in the Middle East have been about
water&mdash;for instance, the wars involving Israel and Syria have
usually been about the headwaters of the Jordan, which come from
Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon. And as a matter of fact, one of the main
reasons why Israel is holding on to the so-called &ldquo;Security
Zone&rdquo; it seized in southern Lebanon [in the 1982 invasion] is
that that area includes a mountain, Mount Hermon, which is a big part
of the watershed that brings water to the region. Actually, the
invasion of Lebanon was probably an attempt, among other things, to
get ahold of the Litani River, a little farther to the north&mdash;but
they were driven back by Shiite resistance and couldn&rsquo;t hold on
to it, so they had to pull back.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, economic facts
are classified in Israel, so you can&rsquo;t be sure of the exact
numbers, but most of the studies on this, including some American
studies, indicate that Israel is getting about a third of its water
from the West Bank. And there really is no alternative to that, short
of some sort of technological innovation&mdash;like, maybe someday
someone will invent a technique of desalination, so they could use
seawater. But at the moment, there is no other alternative: there are
no underground water sources except the West Bank sources, Israel
didn&rsquo;t get the Litani River, they obviously aren&rsquo;t going
to get the Nile&mdash;so there just is no other water source for
them, except the West Bank sources.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And in fact, one of
the occupation policies that the Arabs in the West Bank have found
most onerous is that Israel forbids them to dig deep wells.  Well,
that&rsquo;s very hard on Arab agriculture&mdash;I mean, an Arab
farmer on the West Bank has the same water allotment for farming that
a Jewish city-dweller in Tel Aviv has just for drinking. Think about
that: the drinking-water for a Jewish city resident is the same as
the <i>total</i> water for an Arab farmer, who&rsquo;s got to do
irrigation, and take care of livestock, and do everything else you do
on a farm. And the Arabs are not allowed to sink deep wells, they&rsquo;re
only allowed to sink shallow wells that you do without equipment&mdash;the
deep wells are Jewish wells, only for Jewish settlers, and they get
something like twelve times as much water, or some huge amount more
water.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">59</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, so water&rsquo;s
a big issue that comes up in the documents, there&rsquo;s the
&ldquo;demographic problem,&rdquo; there are historical reasons, and
some other things too&mdash;but the fact is, there is very little
talk about security concerns.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8602_2032848809"></a>Imperial
Ambitions and the Arab Threat<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Well, I
don&rsquo;t know about these cabinet records&mdash;but the fact is
that when Israel was originally conceived in 1948, it was immediately
lunged upon by virtually everybody on its borders: all of the Arab
countries immediately tried to destroy it, and prevent its very
existence. Wouldn&rsquo;t you say the Israeli people are justified in
remembering that history still, as they set national policies today?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you&rsquo;re
right that that&rsquo;s the standard line about what happened. But
it&rsquo;s not true. Keep in mind the background facts. In November
1947, the U.N. General Assembly made a recommendation for a three-way
partition of Palestine into a Jewish state, an Arab state, and a
small internationally-administered zone that would have included
Jerusalem [the area was under British imperial control] .<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">60</font></sup>
Now, I should stress that this was a General Assembly <i>recommendation,</i>
and General Assembly recommendations have no force: they are only
recommendations. Israel <i>insists</i> that they have no force, I
should say&mdash;Israel is by far the greatest violator of General
Assembly recommendations, beginning in December 1948, when Israel
rejected the General Assembly call for allowing Palestinian refugees
the right of return [they had fled violence that broke out in
Palestine beginning in November 1947]. In fact, Israel was accepted
into the United Nations on <i>condition</i> that it accept that
requirement, and it claimed that it would accept it&mdash;but then it
immediately refused to carry through on that promise. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">61</font></sup>
And it goes on right until today: I don&rsquo;t know how many, but
probably hundreds of General Assembly recommendations have been
rejected by Israel.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Anyway, such a
recommendation was made by the General Assembly in November 1947, and
at that point war broke out in Palestine among the Palestinians and
the Zionists [Jewish nationalists]. The Zionists were by far  the
more powerful and better organized force, and by May 1948, when the
state of Israel was formally established, about 300,000 Palestinians
already had been expelled from their homes or had fled the fighting,
and the Zionists controlled a region well beyond the area of the
original Jewish state that had been proposed by the U.N.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">62</font></sup>
Now, it&rsquo;s <i>then</i> that Israel was attacked by its
neighbors&mdash;in May 1948; it&rsquo;s <i>then,</i> after the
Zionists had taken control of this much larger part of the region and
hundreds of thousands of civilians had been forced out, not before.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And furthermore,
there&rsquo;s very good scholarship on this that&rsquo;s come out in
Israel now which shows, I think pretty conclusively, that the
intervention of the Arab states was very reluctant, and that it was
to a large extent directed not against Israel, but against King
Abdullah of Transjordan (what&rsquo;s now Jordan), who was basically
a client ruler for the British. And the Arab states in fact did it
because they felt that Abdullah was just a pawn of Britain, and they
had good reason to believe that he was assisting the British in
reconstructing their imperial system in the region in various ways
[Britain had arranged to turn formal administration of Palestine over
to the United Nations in May 1948]. It&rsquo;ll be a hundred years
before any of this material enters mainstream American scholarship, I
should say&mdash;but it&rsquo;s very good scholarship, and it&rsquo;s
important.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">63</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So anyway, the area
that&rsquo;s now Jordan was being ruled by a British client, and the
other Arab states in the region regarded the Jordanian military,
quite correctly, as just a British army with kind of a guy with Arab
headgear leading them. And they were very much concerned about the
fact (which they knew at some level, even if they didn&rsquo;t know
all of the details) that Abdullah and the Zionists were cooperating
in a plan to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state&mdash;which
in fact did happen, Abdullah and the Zionists <i>did</i> carry out
that plan of partitioning the area that was to be the Palestinian
state between them.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">64</font></sup>
And furthermore, Abdullah also had much greater plans of his own: he
wanted to take over Syria, and become the king of &ldquo;Greater
Syria.&rdquo; And there was apparently a plan in which Israel was
going to attack Syria, and then Abdullah was going to move into Syria
to defend the Syrians and end up afterwards holding the whole pie, by
pre-arrangement. Well, that plan never quite got worked out, as
history shows&mdash;but the other Arab states had wind of it, so then
they moved in against Israel to try to block Abdullah&rsquo;s goals.
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">65</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And there were
powerful reasons for that, remember: this was the period of
decolonization, and the major concern of the people of the region at
the time was to get the British out&mdash;and Abdullah was just a
pawn of the British, and they didn&rsquo;t want to see British
imperialism reestablished. Of course, they didn&rsquo;t want the
state of Israel around either, and they opposed it&mdash;but that was
probably a minor consideration in the attack; really a minor
consideration, actually. In fact, in 1949 both Syria and Egypt made
very explicit proposals for a peace treaty with Israel, and Israel
rejected them&mdash;Israel didn&rsquo;t want such a peace treaty.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">66</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, the reason
all of this material is only coming out recently is there are rules
in Israel about not releasing archives until several decades later&mdash;so
the history is usually written about thirty or forty years late (and
then of course, it&rsquo;s also very distorted for other reasons).
But there&rsquo;s really nothing in any of the things I&rsquo;ve said
that should be a great surprise to anyone who <i>really</i> knows the
history&mdash;yes, now there are archival records and new scholarship
to back it up, and I think it&rsquo;s very convincing scholarship and
will come to be recognized as the right story. But it&rsquo;s really
no great surprise: something like that was always understood. For
example, the agreement between Ben-Gurion [first Israeli Prime
Minister] and Abdullah to partition Palestine has been known for
years&mdash;that&rsquo;s come out in memoirs, everybody&rsquo;s
talked about it, and so on. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">67</font></sup>
But you&rsquo;re right, it&rsquo;s not part of the standard line in
the United States&mdash;it just happens to be the correct story.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But just to
challenge you on some of this&mdash;I thought that what Israel was
trying to preserve in the agreement to partition Palestine was the
idea that Jordan would not send troops into Israel. That&rsquo;s why
they were really cooperating with Abdullah&mdash;Ben-Gurion and the
rest of the Israeli leadership at the time were very concerned about
the fact that there were huge trained armies in Jordan, which were a
big threat to them.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, on the
contrary&mdash;they weren&rsquo;t much concerned about that. In fact,
Ben-Gurion actually had to intervene to prevent his armies from
taking over part of what&rsquo;s now the West Bank [in October 1948],
because the Jordanian Legion had already been essentially destroyed
and was out of arms, and the Israeli military command thought they
could easily take over more territory. See, Yigal Allon, who was the
commander of the Israeli army, didn&rsquo;t know about this agreement
with Abdullah to prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state&mdash;and
there was a bitter battle between Ben-Gurion and the army, in which
Ben-Gurion had to hold the army back in order to honor this secret
agreement he had entered into.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">68</font></sup>
So really there was no military threat from Jordan, not at all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But the
Israeli army held back at that point because Ben-Gurion still had
some hope that perhaps peace would prevail if they held back.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No&mdash;in fact we
know very well what Ben-Gurion wanted, because he left ample diaries
and so on. And his position, which he was very clear and explicit
about&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a lot of documentation about this in my
book <i>The Fateful Triangle</i>&mdash;was that Israel should not
accept <i>any</i> boundaries, regardless of whether there was peace
or not, because the limits of what he called &ldquo;Zionist
aspiration&rdquo; are much broader: they include southern Syria,
Transjordan, big areas which he laid out. And he said, we&rsquo;ll
kind of hold off now, but somehow we&rsquo;ll ultimately get them
all&mdash;in fact, with regard to Lebanon, Ben-Gurion was proposing
that Israel take over Southern  Lebanon on some pretext as late as
the mid-1950s.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">69</font></sup>
So we know all about what he wanted, and like the rest, it&rsquo;s
very different from the stories you always hear.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8604_2032848809"></a>Prospects
for the Palestinians<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Then is
there any hope at all for justice for the hundreds and hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians who have been displaced from their homeland
over the years&mdash;as well as for those who are still in Israel and
the Territories?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the objective
reality is that most of the Palestinian refugees will never go back
to Palestine&mdash;that&rsquo;s just a fact of life, just like the
American Indians will never get back what they had on the American
continent. So in that respect, there&rsquo;ll never be justice. And
there&rsquo;s just no way out of that: if there was ever any prospect
of Palestinians in any large number going back to what was formerly
Palestine, Israel would probably blow up the world, which they&rsquo;re
capable of doing.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">70</font></sup>
And that&rsquo;s never going to happen.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the only question
is, what kind of limited form of justice can be achieved? And that&rsquo;s
tricky. I mean, if Israel can&rsquo;t suppress the Intifada at a
reasonable cost, the United States and Israel might shift from their
rejectionist stance and become willing to accept some variety of
Palestinian self-determination. And if that happens, then you&rsquo;ll
have to look seriously at what you mean by a &ldquo;two-state
settlement&rdquo;&mdash;and the reality is, it&rsquo;s not very easy
to envision, for some of the reasons I&rsquo;ve mentioned: there are
resource problems, there are problems of integration of the areas,
there are border-setting issues. Remember that the U.N. resolution
partitioning Palestine [in 1947] did not strictly speaking call for
two states, it called for an economic confederation&mdash;and that
was quite realistic.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">71</font></sup>
Anybody who&rsquo;s been there knows that two states don&rsquo;t make
much sense&mdash;because the regions are just too closely integrated,
and the borders are too crazy, and when you look even more seriously
you see even further that it wouldn&rsquo;t work. So the only thing
that makes any sense is some sort of confederation. But you can
pretty well predict what will happen: there will be two states,
except only one of the states will really exist, the other one will
just collect garbage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, I suspect
that&rsquo;ll be the next proposal, and it&rsquo;ll all come under
the banner of a &ldquo;two state&rdquo; settlement&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
going to be a lot harder to argue about, because then people will
really have to think behind the headlines to see what&rsquo;s going
on. But achieving some kind of meaningful federation between the
Israelis and the Palestinians, with really divided sovereignty&mdash;that&rsquo;s
going to be extremely hard, we just have to face that. And that&rsquo;s
about the only kind of solution that makes any sense, I think&mdash;it&rsquo;s
the only limited form of justice I can see.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: There&rsquo;s
also the different mentality between the Arabs and Jews that figures
into it too, don&rsquo;t you think&mdash;isn&rsquo;t that always
going to get in the way of peace?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They&rsquo;re the
same kind of people, they have the same kind of mentality. They bleed
when they&rsquo;re cut, they mourn when their children are killed.
I&rsquo;m not aware of any difference between them.</p>

in History<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Do you
think the passage of time can give legitimacy to Israel, even if
maybe it was started out on the wrong sort of basis, displacing the
indigenous population in a racist manner and so on?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, yeah&mdash;the
general answer to your question just has to be yes. If not, we&rsquo;d
have to go back to the days of hunter-gatherer societies, because all
of history has been illegitimate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, take a case
close to the Palestinians, which we as Americans ought to think
about&mdash;take the United States. Now, I think the treatment of the
Palestinians by Israel has been bad, but in comparison to the
treatment of the native population here by our forefathers, it&rsquo;s
been a paradise.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Here in the United
States, we just committed genocide. Period. Pure genocide. And it
wasn&rsquo;t just in the United States, it was all up and down the
Hemisphere. Current estimates are that north of the Rio Grande, there
were about twelve to fifteen million Native Americans at the time
Columbus landed, something like that. By the time Europeans reached
the continental borders of the United States, there were about
200,000. Okay: mass genocide. Across the whole Western Hemisphere,
the population decline was probably on the order of from a hundred
million people to about five million. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">72</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s pretty serious stuff&mdash;it was horrifying right from
the beginning in the early seventeenth century, then it got worse
after the United States was established, and it just continued until
finally the native populations were basically stuck away in little
enclaves. The history of treaty violations by the United States is
just grotesque: treaties with the Indian nations by law have a status
the same as that of treaties among sovereign states, but throughout
our history nobody ever paid the slightest attention to them&mdash;as
soon as you wanted more land, you just forgot the treaty and robbed
it; it&rsquo;s a very ugly and vicious history.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">73</font></sup>
Hitler in fact used the treatment of the Native Americans as a model,
explicitly&mdash;he said, that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re going to do
with the Jews. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">74</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, a book came
out in Germany recently called, in German, <i>The Five Hundred Year
Reich</i>&mdash;actually, it&rsquo;s part of a big effort that&rsquo;s
beginning to develop around the world to try to turn 1992 into a year
of memory of genocide, instead of a year of celebration of the 500th
anniversary of what&rsquo;s  called Columbus&rsquo;s &ldquo;discovery&rdquo;
of America. And in Germany, people understand that title: Hitler was
going to establish a &ldquo;Thousand Year Reich,&rdquo; and the point
of the book is that the colonization of the Western Hemisphere was
essentially Hitlerian&mdash;and it&rsquo;s lasted for five hundred
years.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">75</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I should add,
actually, that throughout American history this genocide has been
accepted as perfectly legitimate. So for example, there were people
who spoke up for blacks and opposed slavery&mdash;there were the
Abolitionists and there was the Civil Rights Movement. But you won&rsquo;t
find much support for the American Indians. And the same was true of
scholarship: for instance, in Samuel Eliot Morison&rsquo;s history of
Columbus&mdash;you know, big Harvard historian&mdash;he talks about
what a great man Columbus was, terrific person and so on, and then he
has this little line saying, of course Columbus did set off a program
of what he calls &ldquo;complete genocide,&rdquo; and he was a major
mass-murderer himself. But then he says, that was only a minor flaw,
he was really a terrific seaman, this and that and the other thing.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">76</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, let me tell
you a personal story to indicate just how far out of history all of
this really is. A few Thanksgivings ago I took a walk with some
friends and family in a National Park, and we came across a tombstone
which had just been put in along the path. It said: &ldquo;Here lies
an Indian woman, a Wampanoag, whose family and tribe gave of
themselves and their land that this great nation might be born and
grow.&rdquo; Okay, &ldquo;gave of themselves and their land&rdquo;&mdash;in
fact, were murdered, scattered, dispersed, and we stole their land,
that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re sitting on. You know, there can&rsquo;t
be anything more illegitimate: the whole history of this country is
illegitimate. Our forefathers stole about a third of Mexico in a war
in which they claimed that Mexico attacked us, but if you look back
it turns out that that &ldquo;attack&rdquo; took place inside of
Mexican territory [the U.S. acquired the area from Texas to
California after the Mexican War in 1848 ].<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">77</font></sup>
And it goes on and on. So you know, what can be legitimate?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Take the development
of the state system in Europe. The state system in Europe, which was
finally sort of established in 1945, is the result of savage wars and
murders and atrocities going back hundreds and hundreds of years. In
fact, the main reason why the plague of European civilization was
able to spread all over the world in the past five hundred years is
that the Europeans were just a lot more vicious and savage than
anyone else, because they&rsquo;d had a lot more practice murdering
one another&mdash;so when they came to other places, they knew how to
do it, and were very good at it. Well, the European state system has
continued to be an extremely bloody and brutal arrangement, right to
today. I mean, there are wars all over the Third World just because
the national boundaries the European invaders imposed on these places
have nothing to do with anything, except where one European power
could expand at the expense of other European powers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, if anything
has no legitimacy, it&rsquo;s this. But that&rsquo;s our nation-state
system, and we just have to begin with it. I mean, it&rsquo;s there,
and it has whatever legitimacy&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t <i>say</i> that
it&rsquo;s &ldquo;legitimate,&rdquo; I&rsquo;d just say that it
exists,  we have to recognize that it exists, and states have to be
given whatever rights they are accorded in the international system.
But the indigenous populations have to be given comparable rights
too, I think&mdash;at least. So when I denounce apologetics for
Israel&rsquo;s oppression, remember, it&rsquo;s not in any particular
criticism of Israel. In fact, I think Israel is just as ugly a state
as every other state. The only difference is that Israel has a
fabricated image in the United States&mdash;it&rsquo;s regarded as
having some unique moral quality, and there&rsquo;s all sorts of
imagery about purity of arms, and high noble intent and so on. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">78</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s complete mythology, just pure fabrication: Israel&rsquo;s
a country like every other country, and we should recognize that and
stop the nonsense. To talk about legitimacy is ridiculous&mdash;the
word doesn&rsquo;t apply, to their history or anyone else&rsquo;s.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8608_2032848809"></a>Qualifications
to Speak on World Affairs; A Presidential Campaign<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Mr. Chomsky,
I&rsquo;m wondering what specific qualifications you have to be able
to speak all around the country about world affairs?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">None whatsoever. I
mean, the qualifications that I have to speak on world affairs are
exactly the same ones Henry Kissinger has, and Walt Rostow has, or
anybody in the Political Science Department, professional
historians&mdash;none, none that you don&rsquo;t have. The only
difference is, I don&rsquo;t <i>pretend</i> to have qualifications,
nor do I pretend that qualifications are needed. I mean, if somebody
were to ask me to give a talk on quantum physics, I&rsquo;d
refuse&mdash;because I don&rsquo;t understand enough. But world
affairs are trivial: there&rsquo;s nothing in the social sciences or
history or whatever that is beyond the intellectual capacities of an
ordinary fifteen-year-old. You have to do a little work, you have to
do some reading, you have to be able to think, but there&rsquo;s
nothing deep&mdash;if there are any theories around that require some
special kind of training to understand, then they&rsquo;ve been kept
a carefully guarded secret.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, I think the
idea that you&rsquo;re supposed to have special qualifications to
talk about world affairs is just another scam&mdash;it&rsquo;s kind
of like Leninism [position that socialist revolution should be led by
a &ldquo;vanguard&rdquo; party]: it&rsquo;s just another technique
for making the population feel that they don&rsquo;t know anything,
and they&rsquo;d better just stay out of it and let us smart guys run
it. In order to do that, what you pretend is that there&rsquo;s some
esoteric discipline, and you&rsquo;ve got to have some letters after
your name before you can say anything about it. The fact is, that&rsquo;s
a joke.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But don&rsquo;t
you also use that system too, because of your name-recognition and
the fact that you&rsquo;re a famous linguist? I mean, would I be
invited to go somewhere and give talks?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You think I was
invited here because people know me as a linguist? Okay, if <i>that</i>
was the reason, then it was a bad mistake. But there are plenty of
other linguists around, and they aren&rsquo;t getting invited to
places like this&mdash;so I don&rsquo;t really think that can be the
reason. I assumed that the reason is that these are topics that I&rsquo;ve
written a lot about, and I&rsquo;ve spoken a lot about, and I&rsquo;ve
demonstrated a lot about, and I&rsquo;ve gone to jail about, and so
on and so forth&mdash;I assumed that&rsquo;s the reason. If it&rsquo;s
not, well, then it&rsquo;s a bad mistake. If anybody thinks that you
should listen to me because I&rsquo;m a professor at M.I.T., that&rsquo;s
nonsense. You should decide whether something makes sense by its
<i>content</i>, not by the letters after the name of the person who
says it. And the idea that you&rsquo;re supposed to have special
qualifications to talk about things that are common sense, that&rsquo;s
just another scam&mdash;it&rsquo;s another way to try to marginalize
people, and you shouldn&rsquo;t fall for it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Seeing as
you&rsquo;re such a big draw with audiences, though, and since you do
have some name-recognition&mdash;I&rsquo;m wondering, what would you
think about running a Presidential campaign? I mean, huge crowds come
out to listen to your talks all around the country, those people
might support something like that and want to begin getting involved
with it.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it&rsquo;s
true about the audiences&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t think that has to do
with name-recognition or anything like that. See, there are only
about ten people in the country, literally, who do this kind of
thing&mdash;John Stockwell, Alex Cockburn, Dan Ellsberg, Howard Zinn,
Holly Sklar, only a couple others&mdash;and we all get the same
reaction. I think it&rsquo;s just a matter of people all over the
country being hungry to hear a different viewpoint. And what&rsquo;s
more, we all get the same reaction wherever we go&mdash;it&rsquo;s
the same in towns where nobody&rsquo;s ever heard of me. Like, I was
in central Michigan last week, they didn&rsquo;t know who I was from
Adam, but it was the same kind of crowd.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: But seeing
as you do get all this draw, why not run a Presidential campaign?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First of all,
there&rsquo;s nobody around to run for President, and if there were .
. .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: You,
Stockwell . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Anybody who wants to
be President, you should right away say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to
hear that guy anymore.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: I&rsquo;m
sorry?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You should say, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want to listen to that person anymore.&rdquo; Anybody who
wants to become your leader, you should say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to follow.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s like a rule of thumb which almost
never fails.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: But what
about just to create a forum where more of the population would hear
this different point of view?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, if you want to
use it kind of instrumentally, like jujitsu or something&mdash;use
the properties of the system against it&mdash;okay. But I don&rsquo;t
really think that makes any sense, frankly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: The form
of government we have just has to be overthrown, in your view?
There&rsquo;s no way of doing it through reform?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s not a
relevant distinction: if you could ever get to the point where a
reformist candidate had a chance, you&rsquo;d already have won, you&rsquo;d
already have done the main thing. The main thing is to develop the
kind of mass support which would make a revolution meaningful. At
that point, some crook will come along and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your
leader, I&rsquo;ll do it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What do you
think could have that effect, though? Just like Noam Chomsky, say,
going and talking to five hundred people here and there? Just keep
plugging away?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, you keep
plugging away&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way social change takes place.
That&rsquo;s the way every social change in history has taken place:
by a lot of people, who nobody ever heard of, doing work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Did you go
through a phase of hopelessness, or . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, every evening.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I feel like
I&rsquo;m kind of stuck in one.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Every evening. I
mean, look: if you want to feel hopeless, there are a lot of things
you could feel hopeless about. If you want to sort of work out
objectively what&rsquo;s the chance that the human species will
survive for another century, probably not very high. But I mean,
what&rsquo;s the point?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You&rsquo;ve
just got to work at it.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, what&rsquo;s
the point? First of all, those predictions don&rsquo;t mean
anything&mdash;they&rsquo;re more just a reflection of your mood or
your personality than anything else. And if you act on that
assumption, then you&rsquo;re guaranteeing that that&rsquo;ll happen.
If you act on the assumption that things can change, well, maybe they
will. Okay, the only rational choice, given those alternatives, is to
forget the pessimism.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8610_2032848809"></a>Soviet
Versus Western Economic Development<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: In a
best-case scenario for the future, how do you envision an economic
system that works?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, our economic
system &ldquo;works,&rdquo; it just works in the interests of the
masters, and I&rsquo;d like to see one that works in the interests of
the general population. And that will only happen when <i>they</i>
are the &ldquo;principal architects&rdquo; of policy, to borrow Adam
Smith&rsquo;s phrase.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">1</font></sup>
I mean, as long as power is narrowly concentrated, whether in the
economic or the political system, you know who&rsquo;s going to
benefit from the policies&mdash;you don&rsquo;t have to be a genius
to figure that out. That&rsquo;s why democracy would be a <i>good</i>
thing for the general public. But of course, achieving real democracy
will require that the whole system of corporate capitalism be
completely dismantled&mdash;because it&rsquo;s radically
<i>anti</i>-democratic. And that can&rsquo;t be done by a stroke of
the pen, you know: you have to build up alternative popular
institutions, which could allow control over society&rsquo;s
investment decisions to be moved into the hands of working people and
communities. That&rsquo;s a long job, it requires building up an
entire cultural and institutional basis for the changes, it&rsquo;s
not something that&rsquo;s just going to happen on its own. There are
people who have written about what such a system might look like&mdash;kind
of a &ldquo;participatory economy,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s sometimes
called.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">2</font></sup> But
sure, that&rsquo;s the way to go, I think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But Mr.
Chomsky, we just went through a long experience with anti-capitalism
like the kind you&rsquo;re advocating&mdash;and it didn&rsquo;t work
out very well. It was tried, and the experiment failed. Why are you
now advocating the same old thing again?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I&rsquo;m not. On
the contrary&mdash;I presume you&rsquo;re talking about the Soviet
Union?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Exactly.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there are
really two points that ought to be made. First of all, the Soviet
Union was basically a capitalist system. The first thing that Lenin
and Trotsky did when they took power in October 1917, remember, was
to destroy all of the forms of socialist initiative that had
developed in Russia since the start of the Russian Revolution in
February 1917 [the Russian Tsar was overthrown by popular revolution
in February 1917; Lenin&rsquo;s Bolshevik Party took over eight
months later in a military coup]. Just now I was talking about
workers and communities participating in decision-making&mdash;the
first thing the Bolsheviks did was to destroy that, totally. They
destroyed the factory councils, they undermined the soviets [elected
local governing bodies], they eliminated the Constituent Assembly
[democratically elected parliament initially dominated by a rival
socialist group, which was to govern Russia but was dispersed by
Bolshevik troops in January 1918]. In fact, they dismantled every
form of popular organization in Russia and set up a command economy
with wages and profits, on sort of a centralized state-capitalist
model.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">3</font></sup> So on
the one hand, the example you&rsquo;re referring to is just the
extreme <i>opposite</i> of what I was talking about, not the same.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Secondly comes
another question. Whatever you think of the Soviet economic system,
did it work or did it fail? Well, in a culture with deeply
totalitarian strains, like ours, we always ask an idiotic question
about that: we ask, how does Russia compare economically with Western
Europe, or with the United States? And the answer is, it looks pretty
bad. But an eight-year-old would know the problem with that question:
these economies haven&rsquo;t been alike for six hundred years&mdash;you&rsquo;d
have to go back to the pre-Columbian period before East and West
Europe were anything more or less alike economically. Eastern Europe
had started becoming sort of a Third World service-area for Western
Europe even before the time of Columbus, providing resources and raw
materials for the emerging textile and metal industries of the West.
And for centuries, Russia remained a deeply impoverished Third World
country.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">4</font></sup> I
mean, there were a few small pockets of development there and also a
rich sector of elites, writers and so on&mdash;but that&rsquo;s like
every Third World country: Latin American literature is some of the
richest in the world, for example, even though its people are some of
the most miserable in the world. And if you just look at the Soviet
Union&rsquo;s economic development in the twentieth century, it&rsquo;s
extremely revealing. For instance, the proportion of Eastern European
to Western European income was declining until around 1913, then it
started rising very fast until around 1950, when it kind of leveled
off. Then in the mid-1960s, as the Soviet economy began to stagnate,
the proportion started to decline a bit, then it declined a bit more
into the late 1980s. After 1989, when the Soviet Empire  finally
broke up, it went into free-fall&mdash;and it is now again
approximately what it was in 1913.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">5</font></sup>
Okay, that tells you something about whether the Soviet economic
model was successful or not.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, suppose we
asked a rational question, instead of asking an insane question like
&ldquo;how did the Soviet Union compare with Western Europe?&rdquo;
If you want to evaluate alternative modes of economic
development&mdash;whether you like them or not&mdash;what you ought
to ask is, how did societies that were <i>like</i> the Soviet Union
in 1910 compare with it in 1990? Well, history doesn&rsquo;t offer
precise analogs, but there are good choices. So we could compare
Russia and Brazil, say, or Bulgaria and Guatemala&mdash;those are
reasonable comparisons. Brazil, for example, ought to be a super-rich
country: it has unbelievable natural resources, it has no enemies, it
hasn&rsquo;t been practically destroyed three times by invasions in
this century [i.e. the Soviet Union suffered massive losses in both
World Wars and the 1918 Western intervention in its Civil War]. In
fact, it&rsquo;s a lot better equipped to develop than the Soviet
Union ever was. Okay, just compare Brazil and Russia&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a sane comparison.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there&rsquo;s
a good reason why nobody undertakes it, and we only make idiotic
comparisons&mdash;because if you compare Brazil and Russia, or
Guatemala and Hungary, you get the wrong answer. Brazil, for maybe 5
or 10 percent of its population, is indeed like Western Europe&mdash;and
for around 80 percent of its population, it&rsquo;s kind of like
Central Africa. In fact, for probably 80 percent of the Brazilian
population, Soviet Russia would have looked like heaven. If a
Guatemalan peasant suddenly landed in Bulgaria, he&rsquo;d probably
think he&rsquo;d gone to paradise or something. So therefore we don&rsquo;t
make those comparisons, we only make crazy comparisons, which anybody
who thinks for a second would see are preposterous. And everybody
here <i>does</i> make them: all the academics make them, all the
development economists make them, the newspaper commentators make
them. But just think for a second: if you want to know how successful
the Soviet economic system was, compare Russia in 1990 with someplace
that was <i>like</i> it in 1910. Is that such a brilliant insight?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, the World
Bank gave its own analysis of the success of the Soviet development
model. The World Bank is not a radical outfit, as I&rsquo;m sure you
realize, but in 1990 it described Russia and China as &ldquo;relatively
successful societies that developed by extricating themselves from
the international market,&rdquo; although finally they ran into
trouble and had to return to the fold.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">6</font></sup>
But &ldquo;relatively successful&rdquo;&mdash;and as compared with
countries they were like before their revolutions, <i>very</i>
successful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, that&rsquo;s
exactly what the U.S. was worried about in the Cold War in the first
place, if you want to know the truth&mdash;that Soviet economic
development just looked too <i>good</i> to poor Third World
countries, it was a model they wanted to follow. I mean, in part the
Cold War went on because it turned out to be a very good way for the
two superpowers to keep control over their respective empires&mdash;each
using fear of the other to mobilize its  own population, and at the
same time kind of tacitly agreeing not to interfere with the other&rsquo;s
domains. But for the U.S., the <i>origin</i> of the Cold War&mdash;and
in fact the stated concern of American planners throughout&mdash;was
that a huge area of the traditional Third World had extricated itself
from exploitation by the West, and was now starting to pursue an
independent course.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">7</font></sup>
So if you read the declassified internal government record&mdash;of
which we have plenty by now&mdash;you&rsquo;ll see that the main
concern of top Western planners right into the 1960s was that the
example of Soviet development was threatening to break apart the
whole American world system, because Russia was in fact doing so
<i>well.</i> For example, guys like John Foster Dulles [American
Secretary of State] and Harold Macmillan [British Prime Minister]
were frightened out of their wits by Russia&rsquo;s developmental
success&mdash;and it <i>was</i> successful.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">8</font></sup>
I mean, notice that Russia is not referred to as a &ldquo;Third
World&rdquo; country today, it&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;failed
developed country&rdquo; or something like that&mdash;in other words,
it did develop, although ultimately it failed, and now we can go
ahead and start reintegrating it back into the traditional Third
World again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And in fact, you can
see that process taking place ever since the Soviet Empire
dissolved&mdash;and with the standard effects. The so-called
&ldquo;economic reforms&rdquo; we&rsquo;ve been instituting in the
former Soviet-bloc countries have been an absolute catastrophe for
most of their populations&mdash;but Western investors and a standard
Third World elite of super-rich are making huge fortunes, in part by
skimming off most of the &ldquo;aid&rdquo; that gets sent there, in
various ways.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">9</font></sup>
In fact, U.N.I.C.E.F. [United Nations International Children&rsquo;s
Emergency Fund] put out a study a little while ago estimating just
the simple human cost, like deaths, of what they call the &ldquo;capitalist
reforms&rdquo; in Russia and Poland and the others (and incidentally,
they <i>approved</i> of the reforms)&mdash;and for Russia, they
calculated that there have been about a half-million extra deaths a
year just as a result of them. Poland&rsquo;s a smaller country, so
it was a smaller number, but the results were proportional throughout
the region. In the Czech Republic, the percentage of the population
living in poverty has gone from 5.7 percent in 1989 to 18.2 percent
in 1992; in Poland, the figures are something like from 20 percent to
40 percent. So if you walk down the streets of Warsaw now, sure,
you&rsquo;ll find a lot of nice stuff in the shop windows&mdash;but
that&rsquo;s the same as in any Third World country: plenty of
wealth, very narrowly concentrated; and poverty, starvation, death,
and huge inequality for the vast majority.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">10</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And actually, that&rsquo;s
the reason the so-called &ldquo;Communist&rdquo; Parties in Eastern
Europe and Russia are getting votes these days. I mean, when they
describe that here, they say, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s nostalgia, they
forget how bad it was in the old days&rdquo;&mdash;but there&rsquo;s
no nostalgia.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">11</font></sup>
I don&rsquo;t think anybody there actually <i>wants</i> to go back to
the Stalinist dungeon again&mdash;it&rsquo;s not that they&rsquo;re
nostalgic about the <i>past</i>, it&rsquo;s that they&rsquo;re
apprehensive about the <i>future.</i> They can see what&rsquo;s
coming very well, namely Brazil and Guatemala, and as bad as their
system was, that&rsquo;s worse. Much worse.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the fact that
Russia had pulled itself out of the West&rsquo;s traditional Third
World service-area and was developing on an independent course was
really one of the major motivations behind the Cold War. I mean, the
standard line you always hear about it is that we were opposing
Stalin&rsquo;s terror&mdash;but that&rsquo;s total bullshit. First of
all, we shouldn&rsquo;t even be able to <i>repeat</i> that line
without a sense of self-mockery, given our record. Do we oppose
anybody else&rsquo;s terror? Do we oppose Indonesia&rsquo;s terror in
East Timor? Do we oppose terror in Guatemala and El Salvador? Do we
oppose what we did to South Vietnam? No, we support terror all the
time&mdash;in fact, we put it in power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Just take a look at
U.S. aid, for instance. There have been a lot of studies of it,
including studies by people who write in the mainstream, and what
they show is that there is in fact a very high correlation between
U.S. foreign aid and human rights abuses. For example, Lars Schoultz
at the University of North Carolina&mdash;who&rsquo;s the major
academic specialist on human rights in Latin America and a highly
respected mainstream scholar&mdash;published a study on U.S. aid to
Latin America almost fifteen years ago, in which he identified an
extremely close correlation between U.S. aid and torture: as he put
it, the more a country tortures its citizens and the more egregious
are the violations of human rights, the higher is U.S. aid. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">12</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, it&rsquo;s
true at this very moment. The leading human rights violator in the
Western Hemisphere by a good margin is Colombia, which has just an
atrocious record&mdash;they have &ldquo;social cleansing&rdquo;
programs, before every election members of the opposition parties get
murdered, labor union leaders are murdered, students, dissidents are
murdered, there are death squads all around. Okay, more than half of
U.S. aid to the entire Hemisphere goes to Colombia, and the figure&rsquo;s
increasing under Clinton.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">13</font></sup>
Well, that&rsquo;s just normal, and like I say, similar results have
been shown world-wide. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">14</font></sup>
So claims about our concern for human rights are extremely difficult
to support: in precisely the regions of the world where we&rsquo;ve
had the most control, the most hideous things you can imagine happen
systematically&mdash;people have to sell their organs for money in
order to survive, police death squads leave flayed bodies hanging by
the roadsides with their genitals stuffed in their mouths, children
are enslaved, and worse, those aren&rsquo;t the worst stories.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">15</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As for Stalin,
leaders in the West <i>admired</i> him, they didn&rsquo;t give a damn
about his terror. President Truman, for example, described Stalin as
&ldquo;smart as hell,&rdquo; &ldquo;honest,&rdquo; &ldquo;we can get
along with him,&rdquo; &ldquo;it&rsquo;ll be a real catastrophe if he
dies.&rdquo; He said, what goes on in Russia I don&rsquo;t really
care about, it&rsquo;s not my business, so long as &ldquo;we get our
way 85 percent of the time.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">16</font></sup>
We get our way 85 percent of the time with this nice, smart, decent,
honest guy, we can do business with him fine; he wants to murder 40
million people, what do we care? Winston Churchill was the same: the
British documents are  now being declassified, and after the Yalta
Conference in February 1945, Churchill was praising Stalin in
internal cabinet meetings as a man of honor we can trust, who can
help lead us forward to a new world, a &ldquo;champion of peace,&rdquo;
&ldquo;illustrious,&rdquo; and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">17</font></sup>
He was particularly impressed with the fact that Stalin didn&rsquo;t
lift a finger while British troops occupied Greece [beginning in
November 1944] and under Churchill&rsquo;s order treated Athens like
&ldquo;a conquered city where a local rebellion is in progress,&rdquo;
carrying out a big massacre to destroy the Greek anti-Nazi resistance
and restore the Nazi collaborators to power. Stalin just stood there
quietly and let the British do it, so Churchill said he&rsquo;s a
really nice guy. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">18</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">None of these guys
had anything against Stalin&rsquo;s crimes. What&rsquo;s more, they
had nothing against <i>Hitler</i>&rsquo;s crimes&mdash;all this talk
about Western leaders&rsquo; principled opposition to atrocities is
just a complete fabrication, totally undermined by a look at the
documentary record.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">19</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s just that if you&rsquo;ve been properly educated, you
can&rsquo;t understand facts like these: even if the information is
right in front of your eyes, you can&rsquo;t comprehend it.</p>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8614_2032848809"></a>&ldquo;People&rsquo;s
Democratic Socialist Republics&rdquo;<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, let me just
end with one last point to do with your question. One of the issues
which has devastated a substantial portion of the left in recent
years, and caused enormous triumphalism elsewhere, is the alleged
fact that there&rsquo;s been this great battle between socialism and
capitalism in the twentieth century, and in the end capitalism won
and socialism lost&mdash;and the reason we know that socialism lost
is because the Soviet Union disintegrated. So you have big cover
stories in <i>The Nation</i> about &ldquo;The End of Socialism,&rdquo;
and you have socialists who all their lives considered themselves
anti-Stalinist saying, &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s true, socialism has
lost because Russia failed.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">20</font></sup>
I mean, even to raise questions about this is something you&rsquo;re
not supposed to do in our culture, but let&rsquo;s try it. Suppose
you ask a simple question: namely, why do people like the editors at
<i>The Nation</i> say that &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; failed, why don&rsquo;t
they say that &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; failed?&mdash;and the proof
that &ldquo;democracy&rdquo; failed is, look what happened to Eastern
Europe. After all, those countries also called themselves
&ldquo;democratic&rdquo;&mdash;in fact, they called themselves
&ldquo;People&rsquo;s Democracies,&rdquo; real advanced forms of
democracy. So why don&rsquo;t we conclude that &ldquo;democracy&rdquo;
failed, not just that &ldquo;socialism&rdquo; failed? Well, I haven&rsquo;t
seen any articles anywhere saying, &ldquo;Look, democracy failed,
let&rsquo;s forget about democracy.&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s obvious
why: the fact that they <i>called</i> themselves democratic doesn&rsquo;t
mean that they <i>were</i> democratic. Pretty obvious, right?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, then in what
sense did socialism fail? I mean, it&rsquo;s true that the Soviet
Union and its satellites in Eastern Europe <i>called</i> themselves
&ldquo;socialist&rdquo;&mdash;but they also called themselves
&ldquo;democratic.&rdquo; Were they socialist? Well, you can argue
about what socialism is, but there are some ideas that  are sort of
at the core of it, like workers&rsquo; control over production,
elimination of wage labor, things like that. Did those countries have
any of those things? They weren&rsquo;t even a <i>thought</i> there.
Again, in the pre-Bolshevik part of the Russian Revolution, there
<i>were</i> socialist initiatives&mdash;but they were crushed
instantly after the Bolsheviks took power, like within months. In
fact, just as the moves towards democracy in Russia were instantly
destroyed, the moves towards socialism were equally instantly
destroyed. The Bolshevik takeover was a coup&mdash;and that was
perfectly well understood at the time, in fact. So if you look in the
mainstream of the Marxist movement, Lenin&rsquo;s takeover was
regarded as counter-revolutionary; if you look at independent
leftists like Bertrand Russell, it was instantly obvious to them; to
the libertarian left, it was a truism.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">21</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But that truism has
been driven out of people&rsquo;s heads over the years, as part of a
whole prolonged effort to discredit the very idea of socialism by
associating it with Soviet totalitarianism. And obviously that effort
has been extremely successful&mdash;that&rsquo;s why people can tell
themselves that socialism failed when they look at what happened to
the Soviet Union, and not even see the slightest thing odd about it.
And that&rsquo;s been a very valuable propaganda triumph for elites
in the West&mdash;because it&rsquo;s made it very easy to undercut
moves towards real changes in the social system here by saying,
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s socialism&mdash;and look what it leads to.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, hopefully with
the fall of the Soviet Union we can at least begin to get past that
barrier, and start recovering an understanding of what socialism
could really stand for.</p>

Organ Trade<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: You
mentioned &ldquo;social cleansing&rdquo; and people in the Third
World selling their body parts for money. I don&rsquo;t know if you
saw the recent Barbara Walters program . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The answer is, &ldquo;No
by definition.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Well, I
have to admit I watched it. She had a segment on some American women
who were attacked by villagers in Guatemala and put in jail for
allegedly stealing babies for the organ trade. The gist of the story
was that the Guatemalan people are totally out of their minds for
supposing that babies are being taken out of the country and used for
black market sale of organs. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">22</font></sup>
What I&rsquo;d like to know is, do you know of any evidence that this
black market trade in children&rsquo;s organs does in fact exist, and
do you think the U.S. might be playing a role in it?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, look: suppose
you started a rumor in Boston that children from the Boston suburbs
are being kidnapped by Guatemalans and taken to Guatemala  so their
bodies could be used for organ transplants. How far off the ground do
you think that rumor would get?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Not far.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, but in
Guatemalan peasant societies it does get off the ground. Do they have
different genes than we do?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: No.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, so there&rsquo;s
got to be some reason why the story spreads there and it wouldn&rsquo;t
spread here. And the reason is very clear. Though the specific
stories are doubtless false in this case, there&rsquo;s a background
which is true&mdash;that&rsquo;s why nobody would believe it here,
and they do believe it there: because they know about other things
that go on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For one thing, in
Latin America there is plenty of kidnapping of children. Now, what
the children are used for, you can argue. Some of them are kidnapped
for adoption, some of them are used for prostitution&mdash;and that
goes on throughout the U.S. domains. I mean, you take a look at the
U.S. domains&mdash;Thailand, Brazil, practically everywhere you
go&mdash;there are young children being kidnapped for sex-slavery, or
just plain slavery.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">23</font></sup>
So kidnapping of children unquestionably takes place. And there is
strong evidence&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think anybody doubts it very
much&mdash;that people in these regions are killed for organ
transplants.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">24</font></sup>
Now, whether it&rsquo;s children or not, I don&rsquo;t know. But if
you take a look at the recent Amnesty International report on
Colombia, for example, they say almost casually&mdash;just because
it&rsquo;s so routine&mdash;that in Colombia they carry out what&rsquo;s
called &ldquo;social cleansing&rdquo;: the army and the paramilitary
forces go through the cities and pick up &ldquo;undesirables,&rdquo;
like homeless people, or homosexuals, or prostitutes, or drug
addicts, anybody they don&rsquo;t like, and they just take them and
murder them, then chop them up and mutilate their bodies for organ
transplants. That&rsquo;s called &ldquo;social cleansing,&rdquo; and
everybody thinks it&rsquo;s a great idea. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">25</font></sup>
And again, this goes on throughout the U.S. domains.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, it&rsquo;s
even beginning now in Eastern Europe as they&rsquo;re being turned
back into another sector of the Third World&mdash;people are starting
to sell organs to survive, like you sell a cornea or a kidney or
something.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">26</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Your own?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, your own. You
just sell it because you&rsquo;re totally desperate&mdash;so you sell
your eyes, or your kidney, something that can be taken out without
killing you. That goes on, and it&rsquo;s been going on for a long
time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you know,
that&rsquo;s a background, and against that background these stories,
which have been rampant, are believable&mdash;and they are in fact
believed. And it&rsquo;s not just by peasants in the highlands: the
chief official in the  Salvadoran government in charge of children
[Victoria de Aviles], the &ldquo;Procurator for the Defense of
Children,&rdquo; she&rsquo;s called, recently stated that children in
El Salvador are being kidnapped for adoption, crime, and organ
transplants. Well, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or not,
but it&rsquo;s not an authority you just dismiss. In Brazil too
there&rsquo;s been a lot of testimony about these things from very
respectable sources: church sources, medical investigators, legal
sources, and others.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">27</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it&rsquo;s
interesting: I didn&rsquo;t see the Barbara Walters program you
mentioned, but I&rsquo;ve read the State Department reports on which
she probably based her stuff&mdash;and they&rsquo;re very selective
in their coverage. They say, &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all nonsense and
lies, and it was all started by the Communists,&rdquo; and they trace
it back to sort of Communist sources&mdash;which doubtless picked it
up, but <i>they</i> are not the sources. The State Department
carefully excluded all the other sources, like the church sources,
the government sources, the mainstream legal investigators, the human
rights groups&mdash;they didn&rsquo;t mention them, they just said,
&ldquo;Yeah, the stories were picked up by the Russian propaganda
apparatus back in the bad old days.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s not where
it comes from. Like I say, the Russians couldn&rsquo;t start these
stories in the Boston suburbs&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a reason why
they couldn&rsquo;t start them in the Boston suburbs and somebody
<i>could</i> start them in Guatemala. And the reason is, there&rsquo;s
a background in Guatemala against which these things are not
implausible&mdash;which is not to say these women are being correctly
charged; undoubtedly they&rsquo;re not, these women are just women
who happened to be in Guatemala. But the point is, that background
makes it easy for people there to be frightened, and in that sort of
context it&rsquo;s quite understandable how these attacks can have
happened.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8618_2032848809"></a>The
Real Crime of Cuba<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Mr.
Chomsky, I&rsquo;m wondering, how do you explain our embargo on
Cuba&mdash;why is it still going on, and can you talk a bit about the
policies that have been behind it over the years?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, Cuba is a
country the United States has considered that it <i>owns</i> ever
since the 1820s. In fact, one of the earliest parts of U.S. foreign
relations history was the decision by Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy
Adams and others to try to annex Cuba. At the time the British navy
was in the way, and they were a real deterrent, so the plan, in
Adams&rsquo;s words, was to wait until Cuba falls into our hands like
a ripe fruit, by the laws of political gravitation.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">28</font></sup>
Well, finally it did, and the U.S. ran it&mdash;with the usual
effects&mdash;all the way up until 1959.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In January 1959,
Cuba had a popular nationalist revolution. We now know from
declassified U.S. government documents that the formal decision to
overthrow Castro was made by the American government in March
1960&mdash;that&rsquo;s very important, because at that point there
were no Russians around, and Castro was in fact considered
anti-Communist by the U.S. [Castro did not align with the Soviet
Union until May 1961, after the U.S. had severed diplomatic relations
with Cuba in January and had sponsored an invasion attempt in April.]
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">29</font></sup> So the
reason for deciding to overthrow the Castro government can&rsquo;t
have had anything to do with Cuba being a Russian outpost in the Cold
War&mdash;Cuba was just taking an independent path, which has always
been unacceptable to powerful interests in the United States.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Strafing and
sabotage operations began as early as October 1959. Then, soon after
his inauguration in 1961, John F. Kennedy launched a terrorist
campaign against them which is without even remote comparison in the
history of international terrorism [Operation MONGOOSE].<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">30</font></sup>
And in February 1962, we instituted the embargo&mdash;which has had
absolutely <i>devastating</i> effects on the Cuban population.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember, Cuba&rsquo;s
a tiny country right in the U.S. sphere of influence&mdash;it&rsquo;s
not going to be able to survive on its own for very long against a
monster. But over the years, it was able to survive&mdash;barely&mdash;thanks
to Soviet support: the Soviet Union was the one place Cuba could turn
to to try to resist the United States, and the Soviets did provide
them with sort of a margin for survival. And we should be realistic
about what happened there: many important and impressive things have
been achieved, but it&rsquo;s also been pretty tyrannical, so there&rsquo;s
been an upside and a downside. However, the country certainly was
succeeding in terms that are meaningful to other populations in the
region&mdash;I mean, just compare Cuba with Haiti or the Dominican
Republic right next door, or with any other place in Latin America
which the United States has controlled: the difference is obvious,
and that&rsquo;s exactly what the United States has always been
concerned about.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, the real crime
of Cuba was never the repression, which, whatever you think about it,
doesn&rsquo;t even come <i>close</i> to the kind of repression we
have traditionally supported, and in fact implemented, in nearby
countries: not even close. The real crime of Cuba was the <i>successes,</i>
in terms of things like health care and feeding people, and the
general threat of a &ldquo;demonstration effect&rdquo; that follows
from that&mdash;that is, the threat that people in other countries
might try to do the same things. That&rsquo;s what they call a rotten
apple that might spoil the barrel, or a virus that might infect the
region&mdash;and then our whole imperial system begins to fall apart.
I mean, for thirty years, Cuba has been doing things which are simply
intolerable&mdash;such as sending tens of thousands of doctors to
support suffering people around the Third World, or developing
biotechnology in a poor country with no options, or having health
services roughly at the level of the advanced countries and way out
of line with the rest of Latin America.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">31</font></sup>
These things are not tolerable to American power&mdash;they&rsquo;d
be intolerable anywhere in the Third World, and they&rsquo;re
multiply intolerable in a country which is expected to be a U.S.
colony. That&rsquo;s Cuba&rsquo;s real crime. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">32</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, when the
Soviet Empire was disintegrating and the supposed Soviet threat in
Cuba had evaporated beyond the point that anyone could possibly take
it seriously, an interesting event took place, though nobody in the
U.S. media seemed to notice it. For the last thirty years the story
had always been, &ldquo;We have to defend ourselves against Cuba
because it&rsquo;s an outpost of the Russians.&rdquo; Okay, all of a
sudden the Russians weren&rsquo;t there anymore&mdash;so what
happens? All of a sudden it turned out that we really had Cuba under
an embargo because of our love for democracy and human rights, not
because they&rsquo;re an outpost of Communism about to destroy us&mdash;now
it turns out <i>that&rsquo;s</i> why we have to keep torturing
them&mdash;and nobody in the American press even questions this
development. The propaganda system didn&rsquo;t skip a beat: check
back and try to find anybody who even noticed this little curiosity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Then in 1992, a
liberal Democrat, Robert Torricelli, pushed a bill through Congress
called the Cuban Democracy Act, which made the embargo still
<i>tighter</i>&mdash;it forbids foreign-based U.S. subsidiaries from
trading with Cuba, it allows seizure of cargo from foreign ships that
trade with Cuba if they enter U.S. waters, and so on. In fact, this
proposal by the liberal Democrat Torricelli was so obviously in
conflict with international law that George Bush himself even vetoed
it&mdash;until he was out-flanked from the right during the
Presidential campaign by Bill Clinton, and finally agreed to accept
it. Well, the so-called &ldquo;Cuban Democracy Act&rdquo; was
immediately denounced by I think every major U.S. ally. At the U.N.,
the entire world condemned it, with the exception of two
countries&mdash;the United States and Israel; the <i>New York Times</i>
apparently never discovered that fact. The preceding year, there had
been a U.N. vote on the embargo in which the United States managed to
get three votes for its side&mdash;itself, Israel, and Romania. But
Romania apparently dropped off this year.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the U.S. makes
its own rules&mdash;we don&rsquo;t care what happens at the U.N., or
what international law requires. As our U.N. ambassador, Madeleine
Albright, put it in a debate: &ldquo;if possible we will act
multilaterally, if necessary we will act unilaterally&rdquo;&mdash;violently,
she meant.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">33</font></sup>
And that&rsquo;s the way it goes when you&rsquo;re the chief Mafia
Don: if you can get support from others, fine, otherwise you just do
it yourself&mdash;because you don&rsquo;t follow any rules. Well,
that&rsquo;s us, and the Cuba case illustrates it about as well as
you could.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The enhanced embargo
has been quite effective: about 90 percent of the aid and trade it&rsquo;s
cut off has been food and medicine&mdash;and that&rsquo;s had the
predictable consequences. In fact, there have been several articles
in leading medical journals recently which describe some of the
effects: the health system, which was extremely good, is collapsing;
there&rsquo;s a tremendous shortage of medicines; malnutrition is
increasing; rare diseases that haven&rsquo;t been seen since Japanese
prison camps in the Second World War are reappearing; infant
mortality is going up; general health conditions are going down.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">34</font></sup>
In other words, it&rsquo;s working fine&mdash;we&rsquo;re &ldquo;enhancing
democracy.&rdquo; Maybe  we&rsquo;ll ultimately make them as well off
as Haiti or Nicaragua, or one of these other countries we&rsquo;ve
been taking care of all these years.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, putting
sanctions on a country in general is a very questionable
operation&mdash;particularly when those sanctions are not being
supported by the population that&rsquo;s supposedly being helped. But
this embargo is a particularly brutal one, a really major crime in my
opinion. And there&rsquo;s a lot that can be done to stop it, if
enough people in the United States actually get together and start
doing something about it. In fact, by now even sectors of the U.S.
business community are beginning to have second thoughts about the
embargo&mdash;they&rsquo;re getting a little concerned that they
might be cut out of potentially lucrative business operations if the
other rich countries of the world stop obeying our rules and just
begin violating it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">35</font></sup>
So there&rsquo;s a lot of room for change on this issue&mdash;it&rsquo;s
certainly something that ought to be pressed very strongly right now.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I think
there&rsquo;s been approval mostly because the interventions you
mentioned were all quick and successful. I mean, if you can do
something where you have an overwhelming advantage, the other side
can&rsquo;t fight back, you can&rsquo;t lose, you&rsquo;ll win in a
couple days and then people can just forget about it, sure, you&rsquo;ll
get a high approval rating. That&rsquo;s just standard jingoism&mdash;but
I do not think that kind of support can be sustained for very long
the way it could a couple decades ago.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The approval ratings
are also high because people don&rsquo;t get any information about
what really <i>happens</i> in these operations. For instance, I don&rsquo;t
think anybody here actually knows what happened in Panama. After the
first couple days of the invasion, the news coverage in the U.S. just
stopped. So there were big round-ups of union leaders, the political
opposition was all rounded up and jailed, and so on and so forth&mdash;but
none of that stuff was even reported in the United States.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">36</font></sup>
Or for example, when Quayle [American Vice-President] went down to
Panama in December 1989, if you watched the news coverage on
television all you saw was everybody cheering&mdash;but if you looked
carefully, you&rsquo;d have noticed that everybody in the crowd was
white. In fact, the <i>New York Times</i> claimed that Quayle had not
 even gone to the black neighborhood in Panama City, El Chorrillo, at
all on his trip&mdash;but that was a flat-out lie.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">37</font></sup>
He did go, the motorcade went through there, and there was an
accurate Associated Press report about it by a good journalist, Rita
Beamish. She said that in the church Quayle went to where all the
television crews were, everybody was cheering, but they were all rich
white folk. She said that as the motorcade went by in the black
neighborhood, people were silent, stolid, looking out the windows of
what was left of their homes, no clapping, no nothing. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">38</font></sup>
Okay, so that story didn&rsquo;t appear in the <i>New York Times</i>,
what appeared was &ldquo;We&rsquo;re heroes in Panama.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or another thing
nobody here knows is that every year since the U.S. invasion&mdash;as
the Panamanians themselves call it&mdash;Panama commemorates it with
a national day of mourning. Nobody here knows that, obviously,
because the press doesn&rsquo;t report it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">39</font></sup>
I mean, the government George Bush installed in Panama <i>itself</i>
described the country as &ldquo;a country under military occupation.&rdquo;
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">40</font></sup> There&rsquo;s
a group of eight Latin American democracies called the &ldquo;Group
of Eight,&rdquo; and Panama was expelled from it in March 1990,
because, as they pointed out, a country under military occupation
cannot possibly be considered &ldquo;democratic.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">41</font></sup>
Well, none of this has appeared in the American press either.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And if you just look
at how the U.S. media presented the <i>reasons</i> for the invasion
at the time, it becomes even more obvious why people in the United
States generally supported it. What were supposed to be the reasons
for invading Panama and getting rid of Noriega?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Drug
trafficking.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Drug trafficking?
Noriega was much more of a drug trafficker in 1985 than in 1989&mdash;why
didn&rsquo;t we have to go and invade Panama and get rid of him in
1985? I mean, if we actually had newspapers in the United States,
which we don&rsquo;t, the first thing they would have asked is, &ldquo;Why
did we have to get rid of Noriega in 1989, but not in 1985?&rdquo;
Well, take a look: what was the difference between 1989 and 1985?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: He was on
the C.I.A. payroll in &rsquo;85.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, he was on the
payroll&mdash;he was <i>our</i> thug in 1985, so therefore we didn&rsquo;t
have to get rid of him. But in the intervening years he was getting
too independent, too big for his britches: he wasn&rsquo;t following
orders, he was supporting the Contadora treaty [a plan for peace in
Central America], and other bad stuff like that.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">42</font></sup>
Well, the United States doesn&rsquo;t want anything like that in its
domains, so at that point we had to get rid of him. But again, none
of this was presented in the U.S. media at the time of these
polls&mdash;what was presented was: he&rsquo;s the narco-trafficker
that&rsquo;s destroying the United States, he&rsquo;s getting your
kid hooked on cocaine. Alright, with that  kind of media
presentation, it&rsquo;s not surprising that 80 percent of the
population would want us to invade Panama and throw him in jail. So
frankly, I would interpret the poll results you mention quite
differently.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, there are
still other things which go into explaining them, I think. For
example, take George McGovern [1972 Presidential candidate who
campaigned on an anti-war platform]. George McGovern did not support
the invasion of Panama&mdash;in fact, about two months afterwards he
wrote an Op-Ed piece in the <i>Washington Post</i> saying he had
opposed it from the very moment Bush did it. But he also said that he
had <i>refrained from saying so at the time.</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">43</font></sup>
So if he&rsquo;d been asked about it in a poll, he probably would
have answered that he <i>did</i> support the invasion. And the reason
is, if you&rsquo;re a red-blooded patriotic American, then when the
government is conducting a violent act you&rsquo;re supposed to rally
around the flag. That&rsquo;s part of our brainwashing, you know&mdash;to
have that concept of patriotism drilled into our heads. And people
really do feel it, even people like George McGovern, somebody who
surely would have been in the 20 percent, but if he&rsquo;d been
polled about it would have voted with the 80 percent. We don&rsquo;t
want to be &ldquo;anti-American,&rdquo; to use the standard
term&mdash;which in itself is a pretty startling propaganda triumph,
actually. Like, go to Italy and try using the word &ldquo;anti-Italianism,&rdquo;
call somebody there &ldquo;anti-Italian&rdquo; and just see what
happens&mdash;they&rsquo;d crack up in ridicule. But here those
totalitarian values really do mean something to people, because there
have been very extensive and systematic efforts to control the
population in ways like that, and they have been highly successful. I
mean, there&rsquo;s a huge public relations industry in the United
States, and it doesn&rsquo;t spend billions of dollars a year for
nothing, you know.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">44</font></sup>
So you really have to be a little bit more careful and nuanced when
you interpret these kinds of poll results, in my view.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the fact is, in
the 1980s and Nineties, U.S. interventions in the Third World have
been of quite a different character than ever before in the past.
Direct U.S. military interventions in the last twenty years have been
guided by a very simple principle, which was not true before in our
history: never attack anybody who can fight back&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
not accidental. So take a look at who we attacked directly in the
1980s. Grenada: a hundred thousand people, the nutmeg capital of the
world, defended by 43 Cuban para-militaries and a couple Grenadan
militiamen. Libya: it&rsquo;s totally defenseless, you can bomb them,
you can knock their ships out of the water, you can do anything you
want to them, because there&rsquo;s no way for them to react. Or look
at Panama: Panama was already under U.S. military occupation at the
time of the invasion&mdash;literally. I mean, American forces were
able to try dry runs on their targets a couple days before the
&ldquo;invasion&rdquo; to make sure everything would go smoothly, and
the whole thing was over and done with in a day or two.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">45</font></sup>
Well, as long as you can carry out an attack against a completely
defenseless target like that, sure, then you can get up and strut
around with manly poses and talk about how brave you are. But you
don&rsquo;t ever attack anybody who can fight back anymore&mdash;if
there&rsquo;s anybody who  can fight back, you&rsquo;ve got to resort
to other methods: subversion, mercenary states, things like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, that&rsquo;s
just a major shift in U.S. policy. It&rsquo;s not a constraint that
Kennedy and Johnson labored under&mdash;when they wanted to attack
some country, they just attacked it, didn&rsquo;t give it a second
thought. Johnson sent 23,000 U.S. Marines to invade and wreck the
Dominican Republic in 1965&mdash;where people <i>did</i> fight back,
incidentally. And the two of them sent a huge expeditionary force of
over half a million men to invade Vietnam, which went on for years
and years without any popular response here. Well, that&rsquo;s the
sign of a big change&mdash;and I think the change is that the
American population simply won&rsquo;t tolerate the traditional kind
of intervention any longer, they&rsquo;ll only accept the kind of
invasion we carried out in Panama.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">46</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s my understanding of the political scene, at least.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8622_2032848809"></a>Muslims
and U.S. Foreign Policy<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Dr. Chomsky,
I have a question. Would you agree that in this attack on the less
powerful people of the world generally, there is also a secret,
vicious war being waged on the Muslim people? And what do you think
is in store for Muslims in general in the world?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it does happen
to be the case that plenty of Muslims have been getting it in the
neck from the United States&mdash;but that&rsquo;s not because
they&rsquo;re Muslims, it&rsquo;s because they&rsquo;re not
sufficiently under control. There are plenty of white Christian
people who are also getting it in the neck. In the 1980s, the United
States fought a vicious war in Central America primarily against the
Catholic Church&mdash;and that means European priests, not just
priests from indigenous origins&mdash;because the Church had started
working for what they called &ldquo;the preferential option for the
poor,&rdquo; therefore they had to go.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">47</font></sup>
In fact, when Americas Watch [a human rights organization focused on
North and South America] did their wrap-up study on the 1980s, they
pointed out that it was a decade framed by the murder of the
Archbishop in 1980 and the murder of six Jesuit intellectuals in
1989, both in El Salvador&mdash;yeah, that wasn&rsquo;t accidental.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">48</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, the Catholic
Church became the main target of the U.S. attacks in Central America
because there was a radical and very conscious change in critically
important sectors of the Church (including dominant elements among
the Latin American bishops) who recognized that for hundreds of years
it had been a Church of the rich and the oppressors, which was
telling the poor, &ldquo;This is your fate, accept it.&rdquo; And so
they decided to finally become a Church in part devoted to the
liberation of the poor&mdash;and they immediately fell under attack.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you&rsquo;re
right, it <i>is</i> true that the U.S. is attacking a substantial
part of the world that happens to be Muslim, but we&rsquo;re not
attacking it <i>because</i>  they&rsquo;re Muslim&mdash;we don&rsquo;t
care if they&rsquo;re Martians. The question is, are they obedient?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is very easy to
prove, actually. For instance, there&rsquo;s a lot of talk in the
U.S. about &ldquo;Islamic fundamentalism,&rdquo; as if that&rsquo;s
some bad thing we&rsquo;re trying to fight. But the most extreme
Islamic fundamentalist state in the world is Saudi Arabia: are we
going after the leaders of Saudi Arabia? No, they&rsquo;re great
guys&mdash;they torture and murder and kill and all that stuff, but
they also send the oil profits from their country to the West and not
to the people of the region, so they&rsquo;re just fine.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">49</font></sup>
Or take non-state agents: I suppose the most extreme fanatic Islamic
fundamentalist in the world is Gulbuddin Hekmatyar in Afghanistan,
who got over a billion dollars of aid from the United States and
Saudi Arabia and is now tearing what&rsquo;s left of Afghanistan to
pieces. Yeah, he&rsquo;s a good guy, he&rsquo;s been fighting on our
side&mdash;narco-trafficker, terrorist, all those things, but doing
what we wanted.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">50</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
if Islamic fundamentalists are organizing clinics in the slums of
Cairo, they&rsquo;re going to have to go, just as the liberation
theologians in Latin America who happened to be Basques&mdash;you
know, blue eyes, blond hair and so on&mdash;had to go. I mean, there
<i>is</i> a racist element to U.S. policy, of course, but the basic
motivation is not that, I think. The real goal is just maintaining
obedience&mdash;as in Cuba, as in Panama, and so on.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8624_2032848809"></a>Haiti:
Disturbance at an Export Platform<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Mr. Chomsky,
Haiti and Jean-Bertrand Aristide [populist Haitian priest elected
president in 1990] have been all over the news in recent years, and
it seems to me our present policies towards Haiti don&rsquo;t quite
fit the overall picture you describe. In that country at least, it
does seem that the United States is trying to institute democracy of
some sort&mdash;after all, we ousted the coup leaders [who deposed
Aristide in 1991] and restored the popularly-elected leader to power
in 1994. It appears to me your thesis might be breaking down a little
on this one, and I&rsquo;m interested if you have an analysis of
that: what&rsquo;s been happening in Haiti?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I&rsquo;ll
start with the context, and we can see how different things are. The
United States has been supporting the Haitian military and dictators
for two hundred years&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a new policy. And for the
last twenty or thirty years, the U.S. has basically been trying to
turn Haiti into kind of an export platform with super-cheap labor and
lucrative returns for U.S. investors. And for a long time it seemed
to be working: there was a lot of repression, the population was
under control, American investors were making big profits, and so on.
Then in 1990, something happened which really surprised the hell out
of everyone. There was this free election in Haiti, which everyone
here assumed would be won by the former World  Bank official we were
backing [Marc Bazin], who had all the resources, and foreign support,
and so on&mdash;but meanwhile something had been going on in the
slums and peasant communities of Haiti that nobody here was paying
any attention to: a lively and vibrant civil society was forming,
with big grassroots organizations, and people getting involved in all
kinds of activities. There was in fact a <i>huge</i> amount of
popular organizing and activism&mdash;but who here was paying any
attention? The C.I.A. doesn&rsquo;t look at stuff like that,
certainly American journalists don&rsquo;t. So nobody here knew.
Well, all of a sudden, in December 1990, these grassroots
organizations came out of the woodwork and won the election.
Catastrophe.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">At that point, the
only question for people who know anything about American history
should have been, &ldquo;how are they going to get rid of this
guy?&rdquo;&mdash;because something like the Aristide victory simply
is not tolerable in our sphere: a populist movement based on
grassroots support, and a priest infected with liberation theology?
That won&rsquo;t last. And of course, the U.S. instantly started to
undermine the Aristide government: investment and aid were cut off,
except to the Haitian business community so it could start forming
counter-Aristide forces; the National Endowment for Democracy went in
to try to set up counter-institutions to subvert the new government,
which by an odd accident are exactly the institutions that survived
intact after the 1991 coup, though nobody here happened to notice
that little coincidence; and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">51</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But nevertheless,
despite all this, within a couple months of the election the Aristide
regime was in fact proving itself to be very successful&mdash;which
of course made it even more dangerous from the perspective of U.S.
power. It was getting support from international lending
institutions, because it was cutting down on bureaucracy; it was
finally starting to put the country in order after decades of
corruption and abuses by the U.S.-backed Duvalier family
dictatorship; drug trafficking was being cut back; atrocities were
reduced far below the normal level; the flow of refugees to the U.S.
virtually stopped.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">52</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, September,
there&rsquo;s a military coup, and Aristide is overthrown.
Theoretically the United States announced an embargo and sanctions on
the new junta&mdash;but that was pure fraud: the Bush administration
made it very clear, instantly, that it was not going to pay any
attention to the sanctions (meaning nobody else in the world had to
pay any attention to them either). Bush established what they called
an &ldquo;exemption&rdquo; to the embargo&mdash;in other words, about
eight hundred U.S.-owned firms were made &ldquo;exempt&rdquo; from
it. The <i>New York Times</i> really had to do a little work on that
one. They described this as &ldquo;fine-tuning&rdquo; the embargo&mdash;you
know, to direct it more exactly against the coup leaders, since we
don&rsquo;t want the Haitian people to suffer, as we&rsquo;ve
demonstrated so clearly over the years.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">53</font></sup>
Meanwhile, total U.S. trade with Haiti stayed not very much below the
norm during the course of this &ldquo;embargo,&rdquo; and in fact, in
1993 under Bill Clinton it went up by 50 percent.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">54</font></sup>
Somehow the free press seemed to miss  this completely. Nobody
thought enough to do what I did: give a call to the Commerce
Department and ask for the trade figures; it takes approximately two
minutes, and you discover exactly what happened. But I guess that&rsquo;s
beyond the resources of the press here, because they never managed to
find it out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, as this was
all going on, the Haitian generals in effect were being told: &ldquo;Look,
murder the leaders of the popular organizations, intimidate the whole
population, destroy anyone who looks like they might get in the way
after you&rsquo;re gone. We&rsquo;ll give you a certain amount of
time to do it, then when your job is done, we&rsquo;ll let you know
and you can go off to the south of France and be very nicely treated;
and don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll have plenty of money when you
retire, you&rsquo;ll be rich and comfortable for the rest of your
lives.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s exactly what C&eacute;dras [the coup
leader] and those guys did, that&rsquo;s precisely what happened&mdash;and
of course they were given total amnesty when they finally did agree
to step down [after a diplomatic mission by former U.S. President
Jimmy Carter in October 1994].<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">55</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, the day
before the U.S. troops were sent into Haiti, a big story to do with
this came across the Associated Press news-wires&mdash;meaning every
newsroom in the country knew about it. What it said was that a
Justice Department investigation had just revealed that American oil
companies were supplying oil directly to the Haitian coup leaders in
violation of the embargo, which everybody knew, but also with the
official authorization of the U.S. government at the highest level,
which not everybody knew. I mean, you could have guessed as much, but
you didn&rsquo;t know for certain that the administration in
Washington was openly permitting American corporations to support the
Haitian junta until this story broke. And what this Justice
Department investigation had found was that the Secretary of the
Treasury under Bush essentially had just told the big American oil
companies, yeah it&rsquo;s illegal, but don&rsquo;t worry about it,
we won&rsquo;t pursue it&mdash;and the same exact thing was going on
under Clinton too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, the following
day I did a Nexis [news media database] search on this, just out of
curiosity, and it turns out that that story <i>did</i> in fact appear
in the American press&mdash;in something called <i>Platt&rsquo;s
Oilgram</i>, a journal for the oil industry. Somehow <i>they</i>
discovered it. It was also in a bunch of local papers, like the
Dayton Ohio Whatever and so on&mdash;just because local editors
aren&rsquo;t always sophisticated enough to know the things you&rsquo;re
not supposed to publish. But it never hit the national press, save
for a couple lines buried in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
somewhere, which didn&rsquo;t give the full picture.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">56</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And remember, this
was at precisely the time when everybody in the country was focusing
on Haiti: there were American troops being sent there, supposedly to
throw out the coup leaders, there were thousands of stories about
Haiti and the embargo, but the media completely silenced this report
of the Justice Department investigation. And keep in mind, that was
the biggest story of the week&mdash;what it said was, there never
were any sanctions,  never: not under Bush, not under Clinton. Well,
that would have given the whole thing away, of course, so therefore
it simply did not appear in the major American media.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the American
troops moved in, and the generals who led the coup basically were
told, &ldquo;You did your job, now you can go away and be rich and
happy.&rdquo; Aristide was finally allowed to return to office for a
few months to finish out his term&mdash;with the popular
organizations that had elected him now massacred. And do you remember
Bill Clinton&rsquo;s big speech about this on T.V. [in September
1994], when he said that President Aristide has shown what a true
democrat he is because he&rsquo;s agreed to step down in early 1996,
when the Haitian constitution says he has to step down? You remember
that? Well, the Haitian constitution didn&rsquo;t say he had to step
down in early 1996&mdash;Bill Clinton said that. The Haitian
constitution says that the president is supposed to be in office for
a term of five years, it doesn&rsquo;t deal with the question of what
happens if three of those five years are spent in forced exile, while
U.S.-trained terrorists have stolen his office and are murdering the
population as he sits in Washington. That&rsquo;s <i>Bill Clinton&rsquo;s</i>
interpretation, it&rsquo;s the United States&rsquo;s
interpretation.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">57</font></sup>
I mean, people who hate democracy as much as we do will say, &ldquo;Okay,
that counts.&rdquo; But if you actually <i>believe</i> in democracy,
that means that the people who voted for Aristide&mdash;which was the
overwhelming majority of the Haitian population&mdash;have a right to
five years with him as president. But just try to find anyone in the
United States who even notices the <i>possibility</i> of this.
Actually, it <i>has</i> been mentioned in Canada&mdash;but I haven&rsquo;t
been able to find a word suggesting it in the United States, again
reflecting just how profound is the contempt for democracy here. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">58</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So Aristide was
allowed in for a few months with his hands tied, and with a national
economic plan being rammed down his throat by the World Bank, a
standard structural adjustment package.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">59</font></sup>
I mean, it was referred to in the press as &ldquo;the program that
Aristide is offering the donor nations&rdquo;&mdash;offering it with
a gun to his head&mdash;and it has lots of nice rhetoric around in it
for the benefit of Western journalists. But when you get right down
to the core part of it, what it says is the following.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It says: &ldquo;The
renovated government,&rdquo; meaning Aristide, &ldquo;must focus its
energies and efforts on civil society,&rdquo; particularly export
industries and foreign investors. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">60</font></sup>
Okay, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> Haitian civil society&mdash;foreign
investors in New York City are Haitian civil society, not grassroots
organizations in Haiti, they&rsquo;re <i>not</i> Haitian civil
society. And what that means is, under these World Bank economic
conditions, whatever foreign resources do come into Haiti will have
to be used to turn the country back into what we&rsquo;ve always
wanted it to be in the first place: an export platform with
super-cheap manufacturing labor and agricultural exports to the
United States that keep the peasants there from subsistence farming
as the population starves.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the upshot is,
things in Haiti have been returned to 1990 again&mdash;but with one
important difference: the popular movements have been decimated.  I
mean, people in Haiti were extremely happy when the coup leaders were
finally kicked out&mdash;and boy, if I&rsquo;d been living there, I&rsquo;d
have been happy too: at least there weren&rsquo;t murderers in
control torturing and killing them anymore. But that&rsquo;s
basically the choice between water-torture and electric-torture,
really. I guess water-torture&rsquo;s better, or so people say. But
the hope for Haitian democracy is finished, at least for the
moment&mdash;it&rsquo;ll just go back to being a U.S. export platform
again. Meanwhile, there&rsquo;ll be more rousing speeches here about
our love for democracy and free elections, and just how far we&rsquo;ll
go to uphold our democratic ideals around the world. Maybe in fifty
years they&rsquo;ll even discover the business about the oil.</p>

and the Spanish Revolution<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Incidentally,
there&rsquo;s a little historical footnote here, if you&rsquo;re
interested. The oil company that was authorized by the Treasury
Department under Bush and Clinton to ship oil to the Haitian coup
leaders happened to be Texaco. And people of about my age who were
attuned to these sorts of things might remember back to the 1930s,
when the Roosevelt administration was trying to undermine the Spanish
Republic at the time of the Spanish Revolution in 1936 and &rsquo;37&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
remember that Texaco also played a role.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, the Western
powers were strongly opposed to the Spanish Republican forces at that
point during the Spanish Civil War&mdash;because the Republican side
was aligned with a popular revolution, the anarcho-syndicalist
revolution that was breaking out in Spain, and there was a danger
that that revolution might take root and spread to other countries.
After the anarcho-syndicalist organizations were put down by force,
the Western powers didn&rsquo;t care so much anymore
[anarcho-syndicalism is a sort of non-Leninist or libertarian
socialism]. But while the revolution was still going on in Spain and
the Republican forces were at war with General Franco and his Fascist
army&mdash;who were being actively supported by Hitler and Mussolini,
remember&mdash;the Western countries and Stalinist Russia all wanted
to see the Republican forces just gotten rid of. And one of the ways
in which the Roosevelt administration helped to see that they <i>were</i>
gotten rid of was through what was called the &ldquo;Neutrality
Act&rdquo;&mdash;you know, we&rsquo;re going to be neutral, we&rsquo;re
not going to send any support to either the Republican side or the
Fascist side, we&rsquo;re just going to let them fight their own
war.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">61</font></sup> Except
the &ldquo;Neutrality Act&rdquo; was only 50 percent applied in this
case.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You see, the
Fascists were getting all the guns they needed from Germany, but they
didn&rsquo;t have enough oil. So therefore the Texaco Oil
Company&mdash;which happened to be run by an outright Nazi at the
time [Captain Thorkild Rieber], something that wasn&rsquo;t so
unusual in those days, actually&mdash;simply terminated its existing
oil contracts with the Spanish Republic and redirected its tankers in
mid-ocean to start sending the Fascists the oil  they needed, in July
1936.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">62</font></sup> It
was all totally illegal, of course, but the Roosevelt administration
never pushed the issue.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And again, the
entire American press at the time was never able to discover
it&mdash;except the small left-wing press: somehow <i>they</i> were
able to find out about it. So if you read the small left-wing press
in the United States back in 1937, they were reporting this all the
time, but the big American newspapers just have never had the
resources to find out about things like this, so they never said a
word.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">63</font></sup> I
mean, years later people writing diplomatic history sort of mention
these facts in the margins&mdash;but at the time there was nothing in
the mainstream.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">64</font></sup>
And that&rsquo;s exactly what we just saw in Haiti: the American
press would not tell people that the U.S. was actively undermining
the sanctions, that there never <i>were</i> any sanctions, and that
the U.S. was simply trying to get back the old pre-Aristide business
climate once again&mdash;which was pretty much achieved.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8628_2032848809"></a>Averting
Democracy in Italy<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, since
you mentioned the U.S. opposing popular democracy and supporting
fascist-type structures in Spain and Haiti&mdash;I just want to point
out that that also happened in Italy, France, Greece, and other
allied Western countries after World War II. I mean, there&rsquo;s a
big history of the U.S. undermining democracy and supporting fascist
elements in the past half century or so, even in the rich European
societies.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s
right&mdash;in fact, that was the first major post-war operation by
the United States: to destroy the anti-fascist resistance all over
the world and restore more or less fascist structures to power, and
also many Fascist collaborators. That happened everywhere, actually:
from European countries like Italy and France and Greece, to places
like Korea and Thailand. It&rsquo;s the first chapter of post-war
history, really&mdash;how we broke up the Italian unions, and the
French unions, and the Japanese unions, and avoided the very real
threat of popular democracy that had arisen around the world by the
end of World War II.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">65</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The first big
American intervention was in Italy in 1948, and the point was to
disrupt the Italian election&mdash;and it was a huge operation. See,
U.S. planners were afraid there was going to be a democratic election
in Italy which would result in a victory for the Italian anti-fascist
movement. That prospect had to be avoided for the same reason it
always has to be avoided: powerful interests in the United States do
not want people with the wrong sort of priorities in charge of any
government. And in the case of Italy, there was a major effort to
prevent the popular-democratic forces that had comprised the
anti-fascist resistance from winning the election after the war.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">66</font></sup>
In fact, U.S. opposition to Italian democracy reached the point of
almost sponsoring a military coup around the late 1960s, just to keep
the Communists  (meaning the working-class parties) out of the
government.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">67</font></sup>
And it&rsquo;s probable that when the rest of the internal U.S.
records are declassified, we&rsquo;ll find that Italy was actually
the major target of C.I.A. operations in the world for years after
that&mdash;that seems to be the case up until around 1975, when the
declassified record sort of runs dry. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">68</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It was the same
story in France&mdash;and the same throughout Europe. In fact, if you
look back, the main reason for the partition of Germany into Eastern
and Western countries&mdash;which was Western-initiated, remember&mdash;was
put rather nicely by George Kennan [of the U.S. State Department],
who was one of the main architects of the post-war world. Back in
1946, he said: we have to &ldquo;wall off&rdquo; Western Germany
(nice phrase) from the Eastern Zone, because of the danger that a
German Communist movement might develop&mdash;which would just be too
powerful; Germany&rsquo;s an important, powerful country, you know,
and since the world was kind of social-democratic at that time, a
unified socialist movement in a place like Germany or Japan would
have been totally intolerable. So therefore we had to wall off
Western Germany from the Eastern Zone in order to prevent that
possibility from taking place.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">69</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In Italy, it was an
especially serious problem&mdash;because the anti-fascist resistance
there was huge, and it was extremely popular and prestigious. See,
France has a much better propaganda system than Italy, so we know a
lot more about the French resistance than the Italian resistance. But
the fact of the matter is the Italian resistance was <i>way</i> more
significant than the French resistance&mdash;I mean, the people who
were involved in the French resistance were very courageous and
honorable, but it was a very small sector of the society: France as a
whole was mostly collaborationist during the Nazi occupation. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">70</font></sup>
But Italy was quite different: the Italian resistance was so
significant that it basically liberated Northern Italy, and it was
holding down maybe six or seven German divisions, and the Italian
working-class part of it was very organized, and had widespread
support in the population. In fact, when the American and British
armies made it up to Northern Italy, they had to throw out a
government that had already been established by the Italian
resistance in the region, and they had to dismantle various steps
towards workers&rsquo; control over industry that were being set up.
And what they did was to restore the old industrial owners, on the
grounds that removal of these Fascist collaborators had been
&ldquo;arbitrary dismissal&rdquo; of legitimate owners&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the term that was used.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">71</font></sup>
And then we also undermined the democratic processes, because it was
obvious that the resistance and not the discredited conservative
order was going to win the upcoming elections. So there was a threat
of real democracy breaking out in Italy&mdash;what&rsquo;s
technically referred to by the U.S. government as &ldquo;Communism&rdquo;&mdash;and
as usual, that had to be stopped.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, as you say,
the same thing also happened elsewhere at the time&mdash;and in other
countries it was much more violent, actually. So to destroy the
anti-Nazi resistance in Greece and restore the Nazi collaborators to
power  there, it took a war in which maybe 160,000 people were killed
and 800,000 became refugees&mdash;the country still hasn&rsquo;t
recovered from it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">72</font></sup>
In Korea, it meant killing 100,000 people in the late 1940s, before
what we call the &ldquo;Korean War&rdquo; even started .<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">73</font></sup>
But in Italy it was enough just to carry out subversion&mdash;and the
United States took that very seriously. So we funded ultra-right
Masonic Lodges and terrorist paramilitary groups in Italy, the
Fascist police and strikebreakers were brought back, we withheld
food, we made sure their economy couldn&rsquo;t function. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">74</font></sup>
In fact, the first National Security Council Memorandum, N.S.C. 1, is
about Italy and the Italian elections. And what it says is that if
the Communists come to power in the election through legitimate
democratic means, the United States must declare a national
emergency: the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean should be put on
alert, the United States should start subversive activities in Italy
to overthrow the Italian government, and we should begin contingency
planning for direct military intervention&mdash;that&rsquo;s if the
resistance wins a legitimate democratic election. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">75</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And this was not
taken as a joke, not at all&mdash;in fact, there were people at the
top levels of the U.S. government who took even more extreme
positions than that. For instance, George Kennan again, who&rsquo;s
considered a great humanist, thought that we ought to invade Italy
even <i>before</i> the election and not allow anything like that to
happen in the first place&mdash;but he was kind of held down by other
people who said, look, we can probably buy off the election by the
threat of starvation and extensive terrorism and subversion, which in
the end turned out to be correct. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">76</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And these sorts of
policies were still being followed by the United States right into
the 1970s, when the declassified records dry up. The end of the
documentation that we have at this point is around 1975&mdash;that&rsquo;s
when the House Pike Committee Report released a lot of information
about U.S. subversive activities&mdash;and who knows whether it went
on after that .<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">77</font></sup>
Most of the literature about this is in Italian, but there&rsquo;s
some in English&mdash;for example, Ed Herman and Frank Brodhead have
a good book on the so-called &ldquo;plot to kill the Pope&rdquo;
disinformation story, which includes an interesting discussion of
some of the more recent material on Italy&mdash;and there are others.
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">78</font></sup> And as I
say, the same sorts of policies also were carried out in France,
Germany, Japan, and so on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, the U.S.
also reconstructed the Mafia as part of this whole effort to split
the European labor movement after the war. I mean, the Mafia had
mostly been wiped out by the Fascists&mdash;Fascists tend to run a
pretty tight ship, they don&rsquo;t like competition. So Hitler and
Mussolini had essentially wiped out the Mafia, and as the American
liberating armies moved into Sicily and then through Southern Italy
and into France, they reconstituted it as a tool to break strikes.
See, the U.S. needed goons to break strikers&rsquo; knees on the
waterfront and that kind of thing, and where are you going to find
guys like that? Well, the answer was, in the Mafia. So in France, the
C.I.A.&mdash;working together with the leadership of the American
labor movement, incidentally&mdash;resurrected the Corsican Mafia.
And the Mafia don&rsquo;t just do it for fun, you know&mdash;I mean,
maybe they also enjoy it, but they want a payoff. And as kind of a
quid pro quo for smashing up the French labor movement, they were
allowed to reconstitute the heroin trade, which had been reduced to
virtually zero under the Fascists&mdash;that&rsquo;s the origin of
the famous &ldquo;French Connection,&rdquo; the main source of the
post-war heroin racket.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">79</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And there were also
covert activities in this period involving the Vatican, the U.S.
State Department, and British and American intelligence to save and
employ many of the worst Nazi war criminals, and use them in exactly
the same sorts of operations the Nazis used them for, against the
popular resistance forces in the West and then in Eastern Europe. For
example, the guy who invented the gas chambers, Walter Rauff, was
secreted off to work on counterinsurgency in Chile. The head of Nazi
intelligence on the Eastern Front, Reinhard Gehlen, joined American
intelligence doing the same kind of work for us in Eastern Europe.
The &ldquo;Butcher of Lyon,&rdquo; Klaus Barbie, worked for the
Americans spying on the French until finally they had to move him out
through the Vatican-run &ldquo;ratline&rdquo; to Latin America, where
then he finished out his career.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">80</font></sup>
That was another part of the whole post-war effort of the United
States to destroy the prospects for independent democracy&mdash;and
certainly it&rsquo;s something which took place.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8630_2032848809"></a>P.R.
in Somalia<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Professor
Chomsky, in light of all this I&rsquo;m wondering, do you think there
has ever been such a thing as a humanitarian intervention by the
U.S.? Take what we were supposed to have been doing in Somalia, for
example: that was framed as a humanitarian action here&mdash;do you
think that was all image, or was there also some reality to it too?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, states are not
moral agents; they are vehicles of power, which operate in the
interests of the particular internal power structures of their
societies. So anybody who intervenes in another country, except maybe
Luxembourg or something, is going to be intervening for their own
purposes&mdash;that&rsquo;s always been true in history. And the
Somalia operation, to take the case you mention, certainly was not
humanitarian.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, the U.S.
waited very carefully until the famine there was pretty much over and
the major international aid organizations, like the Red Cross and
Save the Children and so on, were getting about eighty percent of
their aid into the country (using Somalis to do most of the work, it
turns out) before it decided to move in. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">81</font></sup>
So if the U.S. government had had any humanitarian feelings with
regard to Somalia, it had plenty of time to show it&mdash;in fact, it
could have shown it from 1978 through 1990, when the U.S. was the
chief supporter of Siad Barre, the Somali warlord who destroyed  the
country and killed maybe fifty or sixty thousand people with U.S.
assistance, long before the famine.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">82</font></sup>
But when our favorite tyrant collapsed, the U.S. pulled out, a civil
war then erupted, there was mass starvation&mdash;and the U.S. did
nothing. When the famine and fighting were at their peak, in the
first half of 1992, the U.S. still did nothing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">By around the time
of the November 1992 Presidential election here, it was clear that
Somalia could provide some good photo op&rsquo;s&mdash;if we send
thirty thousand Marines in when the famine is declining and the
fighting is calming down, we&rsquo;ll get really nice shots of Marine
colonels handing out cookies to starving children; that&rsquo;ll look
good, it&rsquo;ll be a real shot in the arm for the Pentagon budget.
And in fact, it was even described that way by people like Colin
Powell [then Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] and others&mdash;they
were saying, well, you know, it&rsquo;ll look good for the Pentagon.
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">83</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Of course, it should
have been obvious to them that pretty soon it was going to turn into
a nightmare: when you put a foreign military force into a country, it
won&rsquo;t be long before they&rsquo;re fighting the local
population. That&rsquo;s almost automatic, even if the population had
welcomed them. Take Northern Ireland, for example: the British were
<i>called in</i> by the Catholic population [in August 1969]; a
couple months later, they were <i>murdering</i> the Catholic
population.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">84</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s what foreign armies are like, the dynamics are clear&mdash;and
in the case of Somalia, it was only a question of time before the
shooting started.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">85</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Then you
were opposed to the whole U.S. operation?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">By that point I was
sort of, like, neutral. I mean, you couldn&rsquo;t really tell
whether it would cause more good than harm, though it was certainly
not a humanitarian intervention. But the more important point is,
there was always a much better alternative.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look: the U.S.
should have given aid right away, and the U.N. should have remained
there throughout the famine. But by the time you got to mid- 1992,
things were already beginning to improve&mdash;and they were
beginning to improve partly under the leadership of a U.N.
negotiator, an Algerian named Mohammed Sahnoun, who was doing
extremely well by all accounts: he was starting to bring local groups
together, he had a lot of respect from all sides in the conflict, he
was working with traditional elders and women&rsquo;s groups and so
on. And they were starting to rehabilitate So-malian society, and to
address some of its problems&mdash;he was just extremely effective by
the testimony of all the international aid agencies, and a lot of
others. But he was thrown out, because he publicly opposed the
incompetence and corruption of the U.N. operation. They simply got
rid of him&mdash;and that means the U.S. supported it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">86</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you see, you
really didn&rsquo;t <i>need</i> an intervention at that time: the
best thing would have been just to continue giving support to Sahnoun
and others  like him, who were trying to bring together the various
parts of Somalian civil society. I mean, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the way
you&rsquo;ve got to do it, or else there isn&rsquo;t really going to
be any lasting progress&mdash;you have to help the civil society
reconstruct itself, because <i>they&rsquo;re</i> the only ones who
can ultimately solve their own problems. And Sahnoun and others were
doing that, so it would have been very efficient just to help them
continue doing it. But of course, that was never a thought here: you
don&rsquo;t get any P.R. for the Pentagon that way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you can ask
whether in the end the Somalis benefited or were harmed by what we
did, and I&rsquo;m not certain what the answer is. But whatever
happened, <i>they</i> were secondary: they were just props for photo
opportunities. Maybe they were helped by it&mdash;I hope so&mdash;but
if so it was purely incidental.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8632_2032848809"></a>The
Gulf War<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Probably the
major U.S. foreign policy event of recent years was the Gulf War.
What would you say was the media&rsquo;s contribution to that? As I
remember it, the coverage in the United States was all &ldquo;rah-rah&rdquo;
support as we bombed Iraq.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s true
there was a lot of that&mdash;but in my view, the much more
significant period for reviewing the media on the Gulf War is not
what people usually concentrate on, and what the media themselves are
willing to talk about: that is, the six weeks of the actual bombing
[January 16 to February 27, 1991], when the constraints on reporting
were naturally pretty tight and there was the predictable patriotic
jingoism. The most important period was between August 1990 and
January 1991&mdash;the period when a decision had to be made about
how to respond to Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s invasion of Kuwait [on
August 2, 1990].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The decision to use
violence is always a very serious one. In a functioning democratic
society&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mean one with democratic forms, but I
stress &ldquo;functioning&rdquo;&mdash;that decision would only be
taken after a lot of public discussion of the issues, and
consideration of the alternatives, and weighing of the consequences.
Then, after appropriate public debate, maybe a decision would be made
to resort to violence. Well, that never happened in the case of the
Gulf War&mdash;and it was the fault of the American media that it
never happened.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look: the
fundamental question throughout the pre-war period was whether the
U.S. would pursue the peaceful means that were available&mdash;and
which are in fact <i>required</i> to be pursued by international
law&mdash;for a diplomatic settlement and negotiated Iraqi withdrawal
from Kuwait, or whether on the other hand we would <i>undercut</i>
any possibility for a diplomatic settlement, and move straight to the
arena of violence.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">87</font></sup>
Well, we don&rsquo;t know whether diplomatic means actually <i>were</i>
available in this case,  but we don&rsquo;t know that for a very
simple reason: Iraq put them on the table, but they were rejected,
and they were rejected <i>at once</i> by the Bush administration
starting in mid-August 1990, and running right through to the start
of the bombing in mid-January. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">88</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What was the media&rsquo;s
role in this? Well, they suppressed the story, basically. I mean,
you&rsquo;d have to be a real media addict to know that Iraq had made
proposals in mid-August 1990 that frightened the State Department
enough so that they were worried they would have to try to&mdash;as
the <i>New York Times</i> correspondent put it in a moment of
carelessness&mdash;&ldquo;reject the diplomatic track.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">89</font></sup>
And that suppression continued right up until the bombing started in
January 1991: there were diplomatic offers on the table, whether
serious or not we don&rsquo;t know, for Iraqi withdrawal in the
context of a conference on regional issues, and other things which
certainly sounded negotiable&mdash;and indeed were <i>regarded</i> by
U.S. Middle East specialists in the government as, as they put it,
&ldquo;serious&rdquo; and &ldquo;negotiable&rdquo; proposals.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">90</font></sup>
But barely anybody knew about this. In Europe, I think virtually no
one knew. In the United States, you could have known it if you read
the one newspaper in the country that actually followed the story,
namely <i>Newsday</i> in Long Island. And <i>Newsday</i> followed it
in part I suspect&mdash;although I can&rsquo;t prove this&mdash;because
they were being leaked material from somebody in the government who
was trying to smoke out the <i>New York Times</i>, which had failed
to publish it. See, <i>Newsday</i> is a very funny publication to see
information being leaked to&mdash;it&rsquo;s good, but it&rsquo;s a
small suburban newspaper. However, it does happen to be on sale at
every newsstand in New York, so when their whole front page has a big
headline saying &ldquo;Iraq Sent Pullout Deal to U.S.,&rdquo; the <i>New
York Times</i> can&rsquo;t pretend not to see it, and they&rsquo;ll
have to publish some sort of back-page acknowledgment and dismissal
the next day&mdash;which is indeed what happened.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">91</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is, by
refusing to allow the discussion and debate&mdash;and even the
information&mdash;that would be the basis for sane decision-making
about the need for war in a democratic society, the media set the
stage for what turned out to be, predictably, a very destructive and
murderous conflict. People don&rsquo;t want a war unless you
absolutely have to have one, but the media would not present the
possibility that there were alternatives&mdash;so therefore we went
to war very much in the manner of a totalitarian society. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">92</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s really the main point about the media and the Gulf War,
in my view.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Of course, it didn&rsquo;t
stop there&mdash;there were also plenty of the things that you
referred to as well. So before and during the war, the Bush
administration had to build up an image in people&rsquo;s minds of
Iraq as a monstrous military superpower, in order to mobilize enough
popular hysteria so that people here would go along with their
policies. And again, the media did their job 100 percent. So I don&rsquo;t
know how well you remember what was going on around the country back
then, but people were literally quaking in their boots about the
extraordinary might of Iraq&mdash;it was a superpower  with artillery
we&rsquo;d never dreamt of, all this kind of stuff.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">93</font></sup>
I mean, this was a defenseless Third World country that was so weak
it had been unable to defeat post-revolutionary Iran in eight years
of warfare [from 1980 to &rsquo;88]&mdash;and that was with the
support of the United States, the Soviet Union, all of Europe, the
Arab oil countries: not an inconsiderable segment of world power. Yet
with all those allies, Iraq had been unable to defeat
post-revolutionary Iran, which had killed off its own officers&rsquo;
corps and barely had an army left: all of a sudden this was the
superpower that was going to conquer the world? You really had to be
a deeply brainwashed Western intellectual even to look at this
image&mdash;a defenseless Third World country threatening the two
most advanced military forces in the world, the United States and
Britain&mdash;and not completely collapse in ridicule. But as you
recall, that&rsquo;s what all of them were saying&mdash;and people
here really believed it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, during the
Gulf War I dropped my scheduled speaking engagements and accepted
invitations to talk in the most reactionary parts of the country I
could find&mdash;just because I was curious what I&rsquo;d see. So I
went to some place in Georgia which is surrounded by military bases;
I went to Lehigh, Pennsylvania, a jingoist working-class town; to
some conservative towns in Massachusetts, to Appalachia, places like
that. And everywhere I went, people were terrified out of their wits.
Sometimes it was pretty amazing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance,
there&rsquo;s a college in northern California called Chico State,
which is where guys like Reagan and Shultz [Reagan&rsquo;s Secretary
of State] send their kids so they won&rsquo;t be infected by
&ldquo;lefties&rdquo; at Berkeley. The place is right in the middle
of four hundred miles of cornfields, or whatever it is they grow out
there, a million miles from nowhere, and when you fly in you land at
an airport that&rsquo;s about half the size of a house. Well, when I
landed there, a student and a faculty member who were like the two
local radicals at the school came out to meet me. And as we were
walking to the car, I noticed we had to go a pretty long distance,
because the airport was all surrounded with yellow police tape. So I
asked these guys, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on, are they rebuilding
the landing strip or something?&rdquo; You know what they said? &ldquo;No,
that&rsquo;s to protect the airport from Arab terrorists.&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;Arab terrorists in northern California?&rdquo; But they
thought so. And when I got into the town, everybody was walking
around in army fatigues and wearing yellow ribbons, saying &ldquo;If
Saddam comes, we&rsquo;re going to fight to the death,&rdquo; and so
on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And in a sense,
people really believed it. I should say, though, that in every one of
these towns I went to, the propaganda line was so thin that as soon
as you started discussing the situation and you made a few jokes
about what the reality was, the whole thing just totally collapsed,
and by the end of the talk you&rsquo;d get a huge standing ovation.
Friends of mine who spoke around the country at the time found
exactly the same thing, incidentally&mdash;Alexander Cockburn, for
instance. But that was the image of Iraq that the media presented
right on cue&mdash;and with the help of that propaganda  cover, Bush
was able to carry out his bombardment for six weeks, and kill a few
hundred thousand people, and leave Iraq in total ruins, and put on a
huge show of force and violence.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">94</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And notice that
contrary to the line that&rsquo;s constantly presented about what the
Gulf War was fought for, in reality it had nothing to do with not
liking Saddam Hussein&mdash;as can very easily be demonstrated. So
just take a look at what happened right after the U.S. bombardment
ended. A week after the war, Saddam Hussein turned to crushing the
Shiite population in the south of Iraq and the Kurdish population in
the north: what did the United States do? It watched. In fact,
rebelling Iraqi generals pleaded with the United States to let them
use captured Iraqi equipment to try to overthrow Saddam Hussein. The
U.S. refused. Saudi Arabia, our leading ally in the region,
approached the United States with a plan to support the rebel
generals in their attempt to overthrow Saddam after the war; the Bush
administration blocked the plan, and it was immediately dropped.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">95</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Furthermore, there
was no secret about the American decision to leave Saddam Hussein in
power after the Gulf War&mdash;and there was even a reason given for
it. The reason was explained by a spokesman for the State Department
at the <i>New York Times</i>, Thomas Friedman. What he said was, it
is necessary that Saddam Hussein remain in control of Iraq for what&rsquo;s
called &ldquo;stability.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;The best of all
worlds&rdquo; would be &ldquo;an ironfisted Iraqi junta&rdquo; that
would rule Iraq the way Saddam Hussein did&mdash;much to the approval
of Turkey and Saudi Arabia, and of course the boss in Washington. But
since they couldn&rsquo;t get the &ldquo;best of all worlds&rdquo;
right then, they were going to have to settle for second best&mdash;namely,
Saddam Hussein himself, so he could rule Iraq, as Friedman put it,
with an &ldquo;iron fist.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">96</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Therefore the United
States did nothing to prevent Saddam from massacring the Shiite
rebels as U.S. troops were stationed all over the region&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s been going on ever since, with his attack on the marsh
dwellers and others. And the only reason why any barriers were ever
put up to his attack on the Kurds in the north was that a huge
international outcry developed in the West, as people here watched
Iraqi forces massacring people who this time happened to have blue
eyes and Western features&mdash;it was just pure racism that no
similar public response ever developed to his assault on the Shiites.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But sure, Saddam
Hussein stayed in power after the war&mdash;and he was supported by
George Bush again, just like before the war. Meanwhile, the real
victim of the bombing and the U.S.-imposed embargo has been the
general population of Iraq. In fact, literally hundreds of thousands
of children have died in Iraq since the end of the war, just as a
result of American insistence on maintaining sanctions&mdash;and by
now the United States and England are alone at the U.N. Security
Council in insisting that the sanctions against Iraq still remain in
effect, even though the formal U.N. conditions for them have by this
point been satisfied.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">97</font></sup>
But again, that&rsquo;s another story you won&rsquo;t see pursued
very far in the U.S. press.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, it&rsquo;s
widely agreed that Saddam Hussein&rsquo;s hold on power has not been
<i>weakened</i> by all of this&mdash;it&rsquo;s actually been
<i>strengthened.</i> For instance, there was an article not too long
ago in <i>Foreign Affairs</i>, the main foreign policy journal, which
pointed out that Saddam Hussein now can at least appeal to
nationalism in the Iraqi population to tighten his rule&mdash;while
the sanctions have turned what was previously a relatively wealthy
country into a deeply impoverished one, with literally more than a
million people dying of malnutrition and disease. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">98</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And this is all
being done by the United States for its own reasons. It has nothing
much to do with disliking Saddam Hussein&mdash;as you can see from
the fact that he was George Bush&rsquo;s great friend and trading
partner right up until the moment of the Kuwait invasion.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">99</font></sup>
Or as you can see from the fact that the Bush White House intervened
repeatedly well into 1990 to prevent the Treasury Department and
others who thought Iraq wasn&rsquo;t credit-worthy from cutting back
on U.S. loan guarantees to their dear friend Saddam Hussein.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">100</font></sup>
Or as you can see from the fact that we supported him again
immediately after the war ended, as he was decimating internal
resistance to his rule with &ldquo;Stormin&rsquo; Norman&rdquo;
Schwarzkopf [the U.S. general] sitting nearby and refusing even to
lift a finger.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">101</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: So you
think in the end the U.S. just wanted to regain control of the
Kuwaiti oil fields that Saddam had captured&mdash;it was just a war
fought for oil?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, a good place
to start if you want to know what something was about is to look to
see what changes it introduced. And particularly in the case of a war
planned in advance where the outcome was never in any doubt, I think
you have solid reason to believe the result was what the thing was
really for in the first place. Well, what changes did the Gulf War
introduce? The one big thing that happened right as soon as the war
ended was that the U.S. arranged the Madrid Conference on the Middle
East [in October 1991], which set off what was called the &ldquo;peace
process&rdquo; that culminated in Israel and the P.L.O. signing the
Oslo Agreement in 1994&mdash;and with that, the U.S. and Israel won
their twenty-year campaign of rejecting the possibility of
Palestinian national rights, flat out.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">102</font></sup>
The Palestinians were basically destroyed. [Editors&rsquo; Note: The
Oslo Agreement is discussed in more detail at the end of this chapter
and in chapter 8.]</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, you didn&rsquo;t
even need hindsight to figure this out, it was perfectly obvious
right at the time of the Gulf War that this was going to happen&mdash;like,
I had an article in <i>Z Magazine</i> saying, okay, now that the Gulf
War is over, the U.S. will try to ram through its rejectionist
program for a settlement of the Palestinian question.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">103</font></sup>
And that&rsquo;s exactly what happened.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So look at what took
place. The last of the annual U.N. votes on the Palestinians was held
in December 1990, and the result was the same as always: 144 to 2,
the U.S. and Israel standing alone against the rest of the  world in
rejecting any sort of recognition of Palestinian national rights.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">104</font></sup>
Then came the U.S. bombardment of Iraq in January 1991. After the
war, the U.S. set up the Madrid Conference and the U.N. didn&rsquo;t
hold any more votes on the Palestinian question after that. The
Madrid Conference was run completely by the U.S.&mdash;it was based
totally on American programs, there was nothing for the Palestinians
at all. The agenda was, Israel takes what it wants from the Occupied
Territories; the relationships between Israel and the U.S.-client oil
monarchies in the region, like Saudi Arabia and Oman and Qatar and so
on (which have always existed, even though they were officially at
war), now kind of rise above the surface and become more overt&mdash;and
the Palestinians get it in the neck, they&rsquo;re offered nothing.
And that was the big effect of the Gulf War: it sort of intimidated
everyone, it was a big show of American power that demonstrated that
the U.S. will use force to get its way wherever it feels like it, now
that the Soviet Union is out of the game. So the Soviet Union was
gone&mdash;there was no longer that space left for Third World
countries to be independent and &ldquo;non-aligned.&rdquo; And also,
the entire Third World just had been devastated by the huge crisis of
capitalism that swept the world in the 1980s. Arab nationalism had
been dealt yet another blow by Saddam&rsquo;s aggression and P.L.O.
tactics of more than the usual ineptitude; so the rulers of the Arab
states had less need than before to respond to popular pressures and
make pro-Palestinian gestures. Well, after all that, it really was no
longer necessary for the U.S. to undermine all diplomatic initiatives
in the Middle East, as we&rsquo;d been doing for the past twenty
years. Now we could just use force. The Gulf War was the first
demonstration of that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So everybody was
scared shitless by it, and Europe finally backed off on the question
of Palestinian national rights: they don&rsquo;t even make any
proposals about that anymore. In fact, it was kind of interesting
that even Norway agreed to be the intermediary in 1993, and to help
implement U.S. and Israeli rejectionism in the Oslo Agreement&mdash;they
wouldn&rsquo;t have done that a couple years earlier.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And that&rsquo;s
primarily what the Gulf War was about, I think. It wasn&rsquo;t about
fear of losing oil. It wasn&rsquo;t about international law, or
principled opposition to aggression or anything like that. It wasn&rsquo;t
that they didn&rsquo;t like Saddam Hussein&mdash;they didn&rsquo;t
care about Saddam Hussein one way or the other. It was that after the
Gulf War was over, the U.S. was in a perfect position to ram through
its rejectionist program and fully extend the Monroe Doctrine to the
Middle East [the Monroe Doctrine was proclaimed by the U.S. in 1823
and stated that Latin America was the exclusive domain of the United
States, not the European colonial powers]. It was our way of saying:
&ldquo;Look, this is our turf, we&rsquo;ll do what we feel like
here.&rdquo; As George Bush in fact put it: &ldquo;What we say goes.&rdquo;
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">105</font></sup> Now the
world understands that; the Gulf War helped them understand it.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8634_2032848809"></a>Bosnia:
Intervention Questions<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, do you
recall any major issues on which your views have totally flip-flopped
at some point, perhaps by thinking them out more or something like
that? It strikes me that your positions have remained extremely
consistent over the years. Or are there issues that you wish you&rsquo;d
written and talked about, but haven&rsquo;t yet?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there are a
lot of major issues on which I simply haven&rsquo;t taken any
position&mdash;just because I don&rsquo;t really know what to say.
For example, take the conflict in the former Yugoslavia in the early
1990s [i.e. after the breakup of the Soviet bloc in 1991 and &rsquo;92,
Bosnia and Herzegovina began the process of seceding from Yugoslavia
and several years of civil war between the Croat, Muslim, and Serb
populations followed]. I didn&rsquo;t really have any opinion on what
to do about that, actually. I never heard a good proposal about how
to resolve it, and I didn&rsquo;t have one myself&mdash;so when
people asked me to comment on it, I just talked about the general
problems and gave no proposal. And in fact, there are plenty of major
issues like that in the world, where I just don&rsquo;t know what to
say&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see any good solutions, or even anything very
helpful that could be done. Fortunately there are hundreds of other
cases where there are obvious things that can be done, and I think
those are the ones where we really ought to focus our attention.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But Bosnia was a
striking example&mdash;just because everybody was talking so much
about it&mdash;of an issue where if anyone had a good idea about how
to stop the atrocities, I missed it. I mean, lots of people said,
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bomb everybody&rdquo;&mdash;okay, great. And there
were a lot of people posturing and preening their feathers about how
they were the only moral ones because they were opposed to what was
happening in Sarajevo [the Bosnian capital, where ethnic warfare
raged in the early 1990s]. Yeah, sure, we all were opposed to what
was happening in Sarajevo&mdash;but what did you propose to do about
it? That&rsquo;s where it got a lot less obvious. Kill the Serbs?
They&rsquo;re human beings too, you know, and it&rsquo;s not like the
position of these Serb peasants up in the hills is zero. I mean,
maybe their lifestyle&rsquo;s not as much like ours as all those nice
Europeans in Sarajevo, but they&rsquo;re people too. In fact, I
should say that there&rsquo;s been a lot of class bias in general in
the Western reactions to what&rsquo;s been going on there, and in the
media coverage in particular. But even if you did decide that it was
the Serb peasants who were the killers and the people in Sarajevo
were like Gandhi, still the question remained: what should you do?
Okay, that&rsquo;s where it got very hard.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And there are plenty
of other issues like that too. Take Rwanda [where more than half a
million people were killed in a civil war in 1994]&mdash;you can see
plenty of things people shouldn&rsquo;t have done, but once the
massacres got started, I don&rsquo;t know of a lot that anybody could
do about them. They were horrendous, certainly, but what exactly
could you do?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8636_2032848809"></a>Toying
With India<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Professor
Chomsky, India is refusing to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty unless the countries that already have nuclear weapons agree
to give them up. That seems to me to be a pretty brazen contravention
of U.S. authority, especially for a poor Third World country like
India. Why do you think they&rsquo;re saying that, and what is the
U.S. reaction going to be to that kind of disobedience?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, India is
basically just saying what everybody else in the Third World <i>thinks</i>
but is afraid to say publicly: that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty is a ridiculous joke. I mean, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty is just a way of ensuring that the rich powerful countries
have a monopoly of nuclear weapons&mdash;not much else. Now,
obviously nuclear proliferation is a bad thing&mdash;but you know, is
it better for the <i>United States</i> to have them? Do we have a
better record in international affairs than India? Well, everybody in
the Third World can appreciate that hypocrisy, but not a lot of them
are willing to get up and say it. In India they do say it&mdash;and
actually that&rsquo;s not so surprising.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You see, India is a
fairly independent country. It was the head of the Non-Aligned
Movement [a coalition of Third World nations at the U.N.], and it&rsquo;s
a big country&mdash;in fact, within a small number of years India
will probably be larger than China, if you project the current
population growth rates.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">106</font></sup>
India was also one of the first countries to be colonized, and it was
destroyed by colonialism&mdash;and however brainwashed Indian
intellectuals may be (and they are), an understanding of that history
is not very deep below the surface. And it does show up in
independence. For example, take Nehru [the first Indian Prime
Minister]: although he was very pro-Western and very anglophile, he
was absolutely <i>despised</i> by American leaders. You should see
the stuff that&rsquo;s coming out about him these days in
declassified American documents, they just hated him with a passion.
And the reason was, he was standing up for some level of Indian
independence. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">107</font></sup>
And that streak of independence in India has remained.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, if you look
over the history of U.S. attitudes towards India since British
decolonization [in 1947], they&rsquo;ve in general been kind of
ambivalent. On the one hand, the U.S. was opposed to India because it
was fairly independent&mdash;it was trying to develop an independent
economy and an independent foreign policy. But on the other hand, the
U.S. was extremely worried about <i>China</i> right next door&mdash;they
were worried about Chinese economic success in the years after their
revolution [in 1949], because they were very much afraid that China
would be a development model that other Third World countries would
want to follow. So we have extensive declassified documents on this
stretching until roughly the early 1960s, and right into the time of
the Kennedy administration the documentary record is very explicit:
the big fear was that China was starting to look too successful.  And
therefore, much as they disliked it, U.S. planners determined that
they had to support India as sort of the democratic alternative to
China, so then they could say to other countries: the Indian way is
better than the Chinese way, be capitalist, have a parliament and so
on. And if you look over the history, that ambivalence did lead to
policy conflicts.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">108</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance, the
U.S. gave very little aid to India. In fact, sometimes it was
absolutely scandalous&mdash;like, right after Indian independence, in
around 1950, India had its last massive famine (under the British
there were famines all the time), and while there aren&rsquo;t very
good statistics, probably something on the order of maybe 13 to 15
million people died from starvation. Well, we have the U.S. internal
records from that period, and at first there wasn&rsquo;t even any
<i>question</i> of giving them aid&mdash;I mean, we had food coming
out our ears, just huge food surpluses, but there was no aid going to
India because we did not like Nehru&rsquo;s independence and his
moves towards non-alignment and neutrality. But then there was a
discussion about whether the U.S. should give India food aid as a
<i>weapon</i>&mdash;that is, we give them some food aid as a way of
forcing them to accept U.S. policies on various issues. And after
that, a little bit of aid was trickled out&mdash;but it was delayed
and conditioned on India&rsquo;s accepting American positions on
things like the Korean War and so on. Nobody knows exactly how many
millions of people died because of that.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">109</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">By the 1960s under
Kennedy, the U.S. was shifting towards giving some aid to India to
make it sort of a counterweight to China, so they&rsquo;d look good
as compared with Communist China&mdash;but again, the aid was with
strings attached. For instance, India badly needed fertilizers, and
they wanted to develop their own fertilizer industry using
hydrocarbon resources&mdash;which they had plenty of, along with a
lot of other energy resources&mdash;but they needed U.S. aid to do
it. And after a big discussion in the United States, which you can
read about in the pages of the <i>New York Times</i> if you look
back, a decision was made here to help them do it&mdash;but only if
they would use <i>Western</i>-based hydrocarbons. So India was not
allowed to develop its own hydrocarbon resources, instead they had to
buy them from the American oil companies, and in addition they had to
allow dominant U.S. control over the fertilizer and any other
industries which developed. Well, India resisted those conditions
very strongly&mdash;but in the end, they had to give in. And you can
read <i>New York Times</i> articles in the 1960s recognizing this
situation, and basically saying: well, the Indians don&rsquo;t like
it, but there&rsquo;s nothing they can do about it, because we&rsquo;ve
got them by the throat&mdash;they&rsquo;ll just have to do what we
want.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">110</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, alright, that
sort of ambivalent dynamic continued through the 1970s and Eighties.
In the 1980s, India had a very fast growth rate, but it also adopted
extremely bad fiscal policies which got them deeply into debt&mdash;and
the debt crisis led them into accepting structural adjustment
&ldquo;reforms,&rdquo; as throughout the Third World. In India&rsquo;s
case, the reforms have actually been fairly moderate, though they&rsquo;ve
still had the usual effects: for  most of the population there&rsquo;s
been a decline, and for an elite sector it&rsquo;s meant wealth. The
country shot into a deep depression right away, but recently it&rsquo;s
been pulling out of it, though still it hasn&rsquo;t recovered the
1980s growth rates&mdash;and of course, the recovery is extremely
inegalitarian in terms of who actually &ldquo;recovers.&rdquo; But
right now the U.S. is very supportive of India, because the country
has opened itself even more to Western control. Still, there&rsquo;s
also this history of independence which doesn&rsquo;t go away so
easily. And sometimes it does show up in India doing things like
speaking up against the hypocrisy of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, when most other Third World countries would be too afraid to
step out of line like that.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8638_2032848809"></a>The
Oslo Agreement and Imperialist Revival<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, you
said that the Oslo Agreement in the Middle East was sort of a
consequence of the Gulf War&mdash;I&rsquo;m wondering, what do you
think are the prospects for the Palestinians now that they&rsquo;ve
signed it? And do you see them still being able to organize
resistance to the Israeli occupation, even without pressure from
international solidarity movements in the West?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, first of all,
it&rsquo;s not the <i>Palestinians</i> who signed anything. It was
the group around Arafat&mdash;and they simply made a decision to
capitulate. And as far as the prospects go for the Palestinian people
right now, in the absence of serious international solidarity
movements, their hopes are dead&mdash;because this agreement was a
complete sellout, it was a total capitulation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">A couple nights ago
I was reading an article in the Israeli press by a friend of mine at
Tel Aviv University, who summarized what&rsquo;s been going on very
nicely. She said: people in Israel are comparing this agreement with
the end of apartheid in South Africa, but the true comparison is with
the <i>onset</i> of apartheid&mdash;with the enactment of the 1950s
laws in South Africa which set up the Bantustans [partially
self-governing black districts].<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">111</font></sup>
And that&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s more or less what the Oslo
Agreement is: it&rsquo;s enslavement, it&rsquo;s a plan for
enslavement, with about as much independence for the Territories&mdash;less
maybe&mdash;as the Bantustans had. So that means that the whole
struggle against apartheid is just <i>beginning</i> right now, not
ending.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Israel and the
United States essentially got the settlement they&rsquo;d been
holding out for for more than twenty years, and for which the U.S.
has blocked every international diplomatic initiative without
exception for well over twenty years. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">112</font></sup>
In 1994 they finally won, the world capitulated&mdash;it&rsquo;s not
that the <i>Palestinians</i> capitulated, the whole world capitulated
on this one. In fact, it capitulated so profoundly that it doesn&rsquo;t
even remember what it stood for for so long.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s amazing
in Europe: Europe has become extraordinarily colonized culturally by
the United States, to an extent that is almost unbelievable&mdash;Europeans
aren&rsquo;t aware of it apparently, but if you go there it&rsquo;s
kind of like a pale United States at this point, yet they still have
this feeling of great independence, so it&rsquo;s even more dramatic.
I mean, Western European intellectuals like to think of themselves as
very sophisticated and sort of laughing about these dumb
Americans&mdash;but they are so brainwashed by the United States that
it&rsquo;s a joke. Their perceptions of the world and their
misunderstandings and so on are all filtered through American
television and movies and newspapers, but somehow by this point they
just don&rsquo;t recognize it. And one of the issues where this is
most clearly demonstrated is with respect to the Middle East. I mean,
it&rsquo;s not ancient history, but on the issue of the right of
self-determination for the Palestinians, the Europeans have just
forgotten what they stood for, at least on paper, until around the
time of the Gulf War&mdash;because anything like self-determination
is completely <i>out</i> of the Oslo Agreement.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">113</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The long-term
arrangement between Israel and the Palestinians now will be in terms
of U.N. 242 alone. [U.N. 242 was a November 1967 United Nations
Security Council Resolution calling for Israel to withdraw from the
territory it had just seized and for a regional peace treaty.] Well,
the whole battle all along has been about whether a settlement in the
Middle East is going to be <i>just</i> in terms of U.N. 242, which
doesn&rsquo;t say anything about the Palestinians, or U.N. 242 plus
<i>other</i> U.N. Resolutions which also call for Palestinian rights.
Well, now it turns out that the answer is just 242&mdash;so Israel
does whatever it feels like.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Right now there are
huge construction projects going up all over the Occupied Territories
(with, as always, U.S. funding), and Israel will just continue with
its settlement program [the idea is to &ldquo;settle&rdquo; Jewish
citizens in the Palestinian territories, which are not officially
part of the state of Israel, to solidify Israel&rsquo;s claim to
them]. And what they&rsquo;ve pretty much been doing is creating a
large bulge of Jewish settlers around this big area they call
&ldquo;Greater Jerusalem,&rdquo; in order to break the West Bank into
two separate parts and enclose Jerusalem&mdash;they&rsquo;re
basically breaking the West Bank into two cantons, where they&rsquo;ll
then gladly cede authority to the local cops to do the dirty business
of keeping order. It would be like asking the New York City police
force whether they would like to turn Harlem over to local
mercenaries to patrol, while they hold on to Wall Street, the Upper
East Side, Madison Avenue, and so on&mdash;if you asked the New York
City police force that, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d be delighted. Who
wants to patrol Harlem?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
in effect what&rsquo;s happening in the Occupied Territories right
now: the idea is, see if you can get local mercenaries, who are still
always under your whip, to run the place for you, while you continue
integrating the area into Israel. Actually, some Israeli commentators
have used the term &ldquo;neocolonialism&rdquo; to describe what&rsquo;s
being done with the Territories, and that&rsquo;s essentially
correct, I think.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">114</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, I think
what&rsquo;s been taking place in the Middle East is really just a
part of something much broader that&rsquo;s happened throughout the
West in recent years, particularly since the Gulf War: there&rsquo;s
been a real revival of traditional European racism and imperialism,
in a very dramatic way. I mean, people often talk about neo-fascists
being on the rise, but I think that&rsquo;s really missing the point:
they&rsquo;re just the froth on the surface. In my view, what we&rsquo;re
seeing now is a profound revival of pure old-fashioned racist
imperialism, with regard to the entire Third World. You see it in
articles by British journalists in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>
about how the best thing we can do for Africa is to recolonize it; it
shows up at the economic level in structural adjustment programs,
which are a big part of how we siphon off the wealth of the Third
World to the rich countries; the anti-immigrant campaigns in the U.S.
and Europe are a part of it; this program for the Palestinians is
another part of it&mdash;and one could go on and on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">115</font></sup>
The idea is, &ldquo;We smashed up the world and stole everything from
it&mdash;now we&rsquo;re not going to let anyone come and take any
piece of it back.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s an attitude I see right on the
surface all over the place in the West these days.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So to go back to
your question, the Oslo Agreement was just a complete capitulation. I
mean, I&rsquo;m not saying it shouldn&rsquo;t have been signed&mdash;like,
maybe that&rsquo;s the best that the Palestinians could do given the
state they were in. But we shouldn&rsquo;t have any illusions about
it: all of their problems are exactly the same, maybe worse. And
unless there&rsquo;s support from the West . . . I don&rsquo;t know
what to say. Without support from inside the imperial countries, no
group in the Third World has any hope. The Palestinians certainly
don&rsquo;t.</p>

</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">. . . I hardly know
what to say. What all of you said reflects, I think very accurately,
the state that we&rsquo;re in. Any place I go to, there are people
like you. They&rsquo;re all interested in significant, important
problems&mdash;problems of personal empowerment, of understanding the
world, of working with others, of just finding out what your values
are; of trying to figure out how people can control their own lives,
and helping each other to do it. We&rsquo;re all facing essentially
the same fact: there&rsquo;s no structure of popular institutions
around within which we can work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You don&rsquo;t have
to go back very far in history to find that in past days, a group
like us wouldn&rsquo;t have been meeting in a place like this: we
would have been meeting in the labor union headquarters. There&rsquo;s
still a residue of that in parts of the world. For instance, I was in
England last week giving political talks, and talks in England are
not in churches or on college campuses, they&rsquo;re in a guild
hall&mdash;because in England there&rsquo;s still a residue of the
period when there was a popular movement, a workers&rsquo; movement,
with its own media, its own places of gathering, its own ways of
bringing people together. There was a time when we had a
working-class culture here too. I mean, I can remember it&mdash;barely,
because I was a child&mdash;but there was a live working-class
culture in the United States not that long ago. My family was in it,
that&rsquo;s how I got my political education. A lot of it was
centered around the Communist Party [U.S.A.], which for the people
who were involved in it didn&rsquo;t mean supporting Stalin&rsquo;s
crimes, it meant saving people&rsquo;s lives in the South, and
unionizing industry, and being at the front of every civil rights
struggle, doing everything that was important.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, the American
Communist Party had a lot of terrible things about it, but it also
had a lot of very good things too. And one of them was this&mdash; I
mean, that was a <i>life.</i> The Communist Party wasn&rsquo;t
something you voted for, it was something where if you were an
unemployed seamstress in New York and you wanted to get away for the
summer, they had a summer camp where you could go and be with your
friends, get into the Catskill Mountains, that sort of thing. And it
was picnics, and meetings, and concerts, fighting on picket lines,
demonstrations, the whole business. That was all just normal life, it
was very organic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And they had their
own media. In fact, you don&rsquo;t have to go back too far in the
United States, a little earlier than that, to find working-class and
community-based newspapers that were roughly at the scale of the
mainstream capitalist press. So a journal like <i>Appeal to Reason</i>,
which was sort of a socialist journal in the early part of the
century, had I think about three quarters of a million
subscribers&mdash;meaning who knows how many people actually read
it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">1</font></sup> And that
was in a much smaller population than today of course, much smaller.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, we&rsquo;re not
in anything like that situation: we don&rsquo;t have parties, we
don&rsquo;t have media, we don&rsquo;t have stable institutions&mdash;so,
this group isn&rsquo;t meeting in a union hall, because there isn&rsquo;t
any such thing. On the other hand, we have other advantages. There&rsquo;s
a tremendous diversity and range of interests and concerns now, and
an awful lot of people are involved. And that gives us a kind of
strength: an organized, centralized movement can easily be crushed; a
very diverse movement that&rsquo;s rooted all over the society&mdash;well,
you can get rid of this piece and that piece and the other piece, but
it&rsquo;ll just come back up somewhere else. So there are both
strengths and weaknesses, and I think we should recognize that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">My own feeling is
that the right approach is to build on the strengths: to recognize
what&rsquo;s healthy and solid about having not hundreds, but
thousands of flowers blooming all over the place&mdash;people with
parallel concerns, maybe differently focused, but at the core sort of
similar values and a similar interest in empowerment, in learning, in
helping people understand how to defend themselves against external
power and take control of their own lives, in reaching out your hand
to people who need it. All the things that you people have talked
about&mdash;that&rsquo;s a common array of concerns. And the fact
that there&rsquo;s a tremendous diversity can be a real advantage&mdash;it
can be a real way of learning, of learning about yourself, and what
you care about, and what you want to do, and so on. But of course, if
it&rsquo;s going to bring about real change, that broad array of
concerns is going to require some form of integration and
inter-communication and collaboration among its various sub-parts.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, we&rsquo;re not
going to develop that sort of integration through the mainstream
institutions&mdash;that would be crazy. I mean, you should not expect
an institution to say, &ldquo;Help me destroy myself,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s
not the way institutions function. And if anybody <i>inside</i> the
institution tried to do that, they wouldn&rsquo;t be inside it much
longer. Now, that&rsquo;s not to say that you can do nothing if
you&rsquo;re already in something like the mass media. People who
have seeped in from the popular movements can have effects&mdash;and
people outside them can also have effects, just by barraging the
editors and so on. I mean, the editors don&rsquo;t like people coming
to their doors and causing trouble any more than politicians do, or
businessmen do. And if you come and you bother them, and give them
material, and pressure them, you can sometimes get results. But in
the end, there really are only small changes that can be made within
the existing institutions&mdash;because they&rsquo;ve got their own
commitments, which are basically to private power. In the case of the
media, they have a commitment to indoctrination in the interests of
power, and that imposes pretty strict limits on what they can do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the answer is,
we&rsquo;ve got to create alternatives, and the alternatives have got
to integrate these lots and lots of different interests and concerns
into a movement&mdash;or maybe not <i>one</i> necessarily, which
somebody could then cut the head off of, but a series of
interconnected ones: lots of associations of people with similar
concerns, who&rsquo;ve got in mind the other people next door who
have related concerns, and who can get together with them to work for
changes. Maybe then we can ultimately construct serious alternative
media&mdash;I mean, not &ldquo;serious&rdquo; in the sense that the
<i>concerns</i> of existing alternative media aren&rsquo;t serious,
but serious in scale, at the point where they can consistently
present people with a different picture of the world, a picture
different than the one you get from an indoctrination system based on
private control over resources. And as to how you can do that, well,
I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any big secret about it&mdash;if
there&rsquo;s any big secret about getting social change, I&rsquo;ve
never heard of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Just keep
organizing.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yes&mdash;large-scale
social change in the past and major social revolutions in the past,
so far as I know, have come about just because lots of people,
working wherever they are, have worked hard, and have looked around
to find other people who are working hard, and have tried to work
together with them when they find them. I think every social change
in history, from the democratic revolutions to things like the Civil
Rights Movement, has worked that way. It&rsquo;s mostly just a
question of scale and dedication. There are plenty of resources
around that people can use; they&rsquo;re very scattered&mdash;but
part of the way the institutions protect themselves is to <i>keep</i>
them scattered. It&rsquo;s very important for institutions of
concentrated power to keep people alone and isolated: that way
they&rsquo;re ineffective, they can&rsquo;t defend themselves against
indoctrination, they can&rsquo;t even figure out what they think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So I think it makes
sense to look at what the institutions are doing and to take that
almost as a key: what they&rsquo;re trying to do is what we&rsquo;re
trying to combat. If they&rsquo;re keeping people isolated and
separate, well, we&rsquo;re trying to do the opposite, we&rsquo;re
trying to bring them together. So in your local community, you want
to have &ldquo;unity groups&rdquo; or whatever they&rsquo;re called,
I  don&rsquo;t know, &ldquo; &lsquo;left&rsquo; unity groups&rdquo;&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t even like the word. But you want to turn them into
sources of alternative action that people can get involved with, and
can join in together to fight the effects of atomization. There are
plenty of resources around, enormous numbers of people are
interested&mdash;and if you don&rsquo;t see organizations that are
doing things, well, figure out what you can do, and do it yourself. I
don&rsquo;t think there are any secrets.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: The greatest
source of information for me in these past couple years has been our
co-op radio. And I trust everyone here supports co-op radio&mdash;if
not, well, you should. Because we have to cultivate and develop any
form of alternate media that is working, or that we can think of that
will work. So I just want to say, hats off to co-op radio: I&rsquo;m
glad you&rsquo;re here.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s certainly
true&mdash;when you go to towns or communities that have alternative
radio or other media that involve community participation, the
general mood is strikingly different. And the reason is, people there
are constantly challenged with a different point of view, and they
can participate in the debates, they&rsquo;re not just passive
spectators. That&rsquo;s the way you learn, that&rsquo;s the way you
discover who you are, and what you really want, it&rsquo;s how you
figure out your own values and gain understanding. You have to be
able to knock ideas off other people and hear them get beaten down in
order to find out what you actually think. That&rsquo;s learning, as
distinct from indoctrination&mdash;and listener-supported radio is
very good in that respect. But the same is true of the whole
tremendous network of alternative media that exists by now on just
about every imaginable issue, all over Canada and the United States.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance, I
don&rsquo;t know how many of you know the journal <i>Z Magazine</i> ,
but it&rsquo;s a political journal that&rsquo;s an offshoot of South
End Press, which brings together interests of essentially the sort
that you&rsquo;ve all been raising here. And it&rsquo;s national, and
you read it in one place and see that people are thinking about the
same things somewhere else, and you write a letter in, or propose an
article and so on&mdash;that&rsquo;s the type of serious
intercommunication that we want to foster. After all, we&rsquo;re
living in a world where you don&rsquo;t have to talk just to the
person who lives next door, we have the same interests as people all
across the world, and these days we can communicate with them. In
fact, as they develop, things like this could really help to unify
the popular movements, and they should be pressed as far as they can
go, I think.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">2</font></sup></p>

Early Peace Movement and a Change in the 1970s<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, there
are two contradictory strains that I can identify in your work on the
question of &ldquo;hope.&rdquo; On the one hand, you speak about the
efforts  organizing on behalf of Central America and East Timor and
other activist causes&mdash;some of the successes that people like us
have had. But on the other hand, I hear you always talking about the
destructions the U.S. and other powers are causing all over the
world, and it seems to me that you draw a picture of an overall
global trend which is very despairing. I&rsquo;m wondering, how do
you deal with that tension personally&mdash;do you just keep doing
what you do because it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, or do you
actually have a sense of hope in it?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Do I personally?
Well, first of all, I don&rsquo;t think that matters very
much&mdash;because that&rsquo;s only a reflection of <i>my</i>
personality and mood, and who gives a damn? But if I try to be
realistic about it and ask myself what I could say that would mean
something to someone else&mdash;well, you know, twenty-five years ago
I did it because I thought you just have to do it, you can&rsquo;t
look yourself in the mirror if you don&rsquo;t do it. I didn&rsquo;t
think that there was any hope at all at the time. I mean, when I got
involved in the anti-Vietnam War movement, it seemed to me <i>impossible</i>
that it would ever have any effect. In fact, the few of us who got
involved in the early Sixties confidently expected that the only
consequence of what we were doing would be that we&rsquo;d spend
years and years in jail and destroy our lives; I came very close to
that, incidentally.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, just to tell
you personally, when I got started actively in the peace movement my
wife went back to college, because we figured that somebody was going
to have to support the kids, I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to. And
in fact, there were only two reasons why that didn&rsquo;t happen.
One was, the F.B.I. was too incompetent and ideologically fanatic to
figure out what I was doing&mdash;that&rsquo;s not a joke actually,
and it&rsquo;s something to bear in mind. And the other was, the Tet
Offensive happened in 1968, and it changed U.S. government policy
towards the war, so they began to cancel the prosecutions of
activists that were under way. In fact, the Tet Offensive even
changed people&rsquo;s heads&mdash;you know who was prosecuting those
trials? Ramsey Clark, just to illustrate how things have changed.
[Clark was President Johnson&rsquo;s Attorney General and is now a
radical political activist.]</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But those were
pretty difficult days: it was real confrontation with state power,
and it was getting ugly, especially if you were involved in
resistance, helping deserters, that sort of thing. And it was just
<i>impossible</i> at that time to imagine that anything would come
out of it. And that was wrong, a lot came out of it&mdash;not out of
what I did, but out of what lots and lots of people were doing all
over the country. A lot came out of it. So looking back, I think my
evaluation of the &ldquo;hope&rdquo; was much too pessimistic: it was
based on a complete misunderstanding. I was sort of believing what I
read. And the immediate experience supported it&mdash;like, right
off, you found that when you tried to give a talk you needed two
hundred cops to save you from being lynched. But it didn&rsquo;t take
too long for that to change, and in a couple years it had changed
very significantly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, I don&rsquo;t
think what happened with the movements in the 1960s led to very much
sophistication and insight, frankly&mdash;but I think what happened
in the later years did. And exactly how that worked I don&rsquo;t
really understand at all. But something happened in the 1970s that
just changed things&mdash;people were looking at things differently.
It wasn&rsquo;t just, &ldquo;I hate that they&rsquo;re dropping
napalm on babies,&rdquo; it was, &ldquo;I really want to change the
world, and I don&rsquo;t like coercion and control,&rdquo; and that
kind of thing. That happened in the Seventies, and you can certainly
see the consequences. I mean, in the 1960s, I never even talked about
the nature of the institutions or capitalism&mdash;it was just too
exotic. Now I don&rsquo;t cut corners: I can be giving a talk in
eastern Kentucky or in central Iowa or something, and I say exactly
what I think. And people understand it&mdash;they may not agree, they
may be surprised, but they want to listen and think about it, and
they take it seriously. So I think there&rsquo;s reason to be
hopeful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But on the other
hand, don&rsquo;t forget, the people with power in the society are
watching all these things too, and <i>they</i> have institutions.
They can learn, they can see what didn&rsquo;t work the last time and
do it better the next time&mdash;and they have plenty of resources to
try out different strategies. On our side what happens is, people
forget. I mean, it <i>does</i> take skills to organize, it&rsquo;s
not that simple. You want to organize a demonstration or a
letter-writing campaign or do fundraising, it does take skills&mdash;and
those skills tend to get lost. You can see it happening over and
over. The people who do it the first time around work hard and learn
how to do things, then get burnt out and drift off to something else.
Then another issue comes up, and others with a roughly similar
understanding, but maybe a little younger or less experienced, have
to start over again and learn all the skills from the beginning. How
do you organize a meeting? How do you get leaflets out? Is it worth
approaching the press? In what way do you approach them? Well, since
we don&rsquo;t have stable popular institutions, all these things
that you kind of get in your bones after a while if you do a lot of
organizing do not become part of the common lore that the movements
could call on and improve upon, if we only had more integration and
more continuity. But for people with power, there <i>is</i> a common
lore, and they <i>do</i> improve upon it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, this is
part of an ongoing battle that stretches back to the seventeenth
century. If you go back to the beginnings of the modern version of
democracy, it&rsquo;s the same conflict: people are trying to figure
out ways to control their own lives, and people with power are trying
to stop them. Now, until we dissolve the centers of private power and
really get popular control over how the most crucial decisions in the
society get made&mdash;like the decisions about what&rsquo;s produced
and what&rsquo;s invested and so on&mdash;this battle is always going
to go on. But yes, there have been both victories and defeats: you
can look at the course of events and see many significant victories
by gangsters and murderers and thugs, and you can also see many
respects in which people have been able to stop them, and limit their
victories, and offer people an opportunity to keep living and to
improve their lives. So it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to be either
optimistic or pessimistic, I think. You  just look at what&rsquo;s
happening and try to do the best you can under those circumstances.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Can I give

figure, the most pessimistic way to look at it is, it&rsquo;s really
bad: fifty thousand nuclear bombs floating around, we don&rsquo;t

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But do you
ever succeed, or do you just keep fighting?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, see, you <i>have</i>
succeeded&mdash;things are better than they would have been if you
hadn&rsquo;t done it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>ANOTHER WOMAN:
And we should remember that the mainstream media obviously won&rsquo;t
publicize and draw attention to the successes&mdash;so we have to
keep reminding ourselves of just how much we have achieved. I think
we get burned out when we stop reminding ourselves of that.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s right,
we should always bear that in mind&mdash;that they&rsquo;re <i>not</i>
going to tell us we&rsquo;re succeeding, it would be against their
interests to tell us that. The media&rsquo;s part of what popular
organizing has to oppose, remember. And they&rsquo;re not going to
function in a way so as to self-destruct.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance, take
this supposed big phenomenon that swept the country in the 1970s, the
&ldquo;Culture of Narcissism,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Me Generation&rdquo;
and so on. I&rsquo;m just convinced that that whole thing was crafted
by the public relations industry to tell mainly young people, &ldquo;Look,
this is who you are&mdash;you don&rsquo;t care about all this
solidarity and sympathy and helping people&rdquo; that had started to
break out. And of course, that&rsquo;s what they <i>would</i> do. In
fact, they shouldn&rsquo;t get their salaries if they don&rsquo;t do
things like that. We should <i>expect</i> them to do it, we should
expect them to tell us: &ldquo;You guys can&rsquo;t do anything,
you&rsquo;re all alone, you&rsquo;re each separate; you&rsquo;ve
never  achieved anything, and you never <i>will</i> achieve
anything.&rdquo; <i>Of course</i> they should tell us that&mdash;and
they should even tell us, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t <i>want</i> to
achieve anything, all you want to do is consume more.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As long as power&rsquo;s
concentrated, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s going to tell us&mdash;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s
no point in working to help other people, you don&rsquo;t care about
them, you&rsquo;re just out for yourself.&rdquo; Sure it&rsquo;s
going to tell us that, because that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s in its
interests. There&rsquo;s no point in telling ourselves, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
lying to us&rdquo; over and over again. Of course they are; it&rsquo;s
like saying the sun&rsquo;s setting or something like that. Obviously
they are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So what we want to
try to do is develop stable enough structures so that we can learn
these kinds of things and not keep getting beaten down by the
indoctrination&mdash;so we don&rsquo;t have to keep fighting the same
battles over and over again, we can go on to new ones, and bigger
ones, better ones. I think that could be done; slowly, over time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Do you see
any of those sorts of continuing progressive structures developing
these days in the United States?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There isn&rsquo;t a
lot, it&rsquo;s mostly local. So I&rsquo;ll go to some place like
Detroit, say, and there&rsquo;ll be a meeting like this with people
from different parts of the city who are working on different
things&mdash;but many of them don&rsquo;t even know about the others.
Everything is pretty much fractionated. Now, if you go to a small
town which has listener-supported radio&mdash;like Boulder, Colorado,
for instance&mdash;it&rsquo;s different, it&rsquo;s unified. And part
of the reason it&rsquo;s unified is because of one community radio
station and a couple of journals and so on that everybody can be a
part of. Or I remember going to some town in New Hampshire which
happened to have a movement bookstore, and everybody went to the
bookstore to find out what was going on, you&rsquo;d go there and
look at what&rsquo;s on the wall and stick together that way. You do
find things like that around the country.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But take Boston,
where there&rsquo;s nothing central to bring people together&mdash;there&rsquo;s
no community radio, there&rsquo;s no community newspaper. I mean,
there are lots of people doing all sorts of activist work, but they
don&rsquo;t even know about each other: there&rsquo;s a group in one
section working on Bikes for Nicaragua, there&rsquo;s a group in
another section of the city working on a Sister Cities program for
Central America, they don&rsquo;t even know of each other&rsquo;s
existence.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8644_2032848809"></a>The
Nuclear Freeze Movement<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: What else
do you feel we can learn from organizations you don&rsquo;t think are
going about it the right way?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there are
plenty of groups around that are doing things I don&rsquo;t think are
very constructive, even though I&rsquo;m often a member of them and
give them support and so on. Take the nuclear freeze campaign, for
example: I really thought they were going about it the wrong way. The
nuclear freeze campaign was in a way one of the most successful
popular organizing movements in history: they managed to get 75
percent of the American population in favor of a nuclear freeze at a
time when there was no articulate public support for that
position&mdash;there wasn&rsquo;t a newspaper, a political figure,
anybody who came out publicly for it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">3</font></sup>
Now, in a way that&rsquo;s a tremendous achievement. But frankly I
didn&rsquo;t think it was an achievement, I thought the disarmament
movement was going to collapse&mdash;and in fact, it did collapse.
And the reason it collapsed is, it wasn&rsquo;t based on anything: it
was based on nothing except people signing a petition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, if you sign
a petition it&rsquo;s kind of nice&mdash;but that&rsquo;s the end of
it, you just go back home and do whatever you were doing: there&rsquo;s
no continuity, there&rsquo;s no real engagement, it&rsquo;s not
sustained activity that builds up a community of activism. Well, an
awful lot of the political work I see in the United States is of that
type.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, if we had
stable popular institutions, we&rsquo;d be able to remember how we
failed the last time, instead of somebody else doing it all over
again and making the same mistakes&mdash;we&rsquo;d know that&rsquo;s
not the way to do anything. The nuclear freeze movement amounted to a
public opinion poll, basically: they found out that three times as
many people want the government to spend the money on Medicare and
things like that as want it spent on nuclear weapons. So what? What
are they going to do about it? Nothing. So all these nuclear freeze
people did was answer a poll question&mdash;that&rsquo;s not
organizing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think an awful lot
of movement activity goes into things like that, and it doesn&rsquo;t
get anywhere&mdash;in fact, that&rsquo;s what leads to burn-out. I
mean, you had all these people collecting all these signatures, and
they worked hard, they got so many signatures you could show that
almost all of the country wants a nuclear freeze. Then they went to
the Democratic Party Convention [in 1984] and presented their
results, and everybody there said, &ldquo;Gee, that&rsquo;s really
nice that you did that, we&rsquo;re going to support you all the
way&rdquo;&mdash;then the Democrats went off to the election and
never mentioned it again, unless they were talking in some town where
they figured they could score some easy points by referring to it:
you know, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to remember in this town you want to
say so on and so forth.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the kind of thing that
gets people frustrated, and makes them give up. But that&rsquo;s
because they started with illusions about how power operates and how
you effect change&mdash;and we shouldn&rsquo;t have those illusions,
any more than we should have illusions about whether the media&rsquo;s
telling you the truth. If you don&rsquo;t have the illusions, then
you don&rsquo;t get burnt out by the failure&mdash;and the way we
overcome the illusions is by developing our own institutions, where
we can learn from experiences like this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance, if we
see a big organizing effort where everybody signs the petitions and
some people try to introduce the issue into the &rsquo;84 Democratic
Party platform, and it has absolutely no effect, and a year later
Mikhail  Gorbachev [Soviet leader] declares a unilateral nuclear test
freeze and <i>still</i> there&rsquo;s no effect&mdash;well, we should
be learning something.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">4</font></sup>
Then we should be carrying on to the next step. But that wasn&rsquo;t
the reaction of the nuclear freeze organizers. The reaction among the
organizers wasn&rsquo;t, &ldquo;Well, we obviously misunderstood the
way things work&rdquo;&mdash;it was, &ldquo;We did the right thing,
but we partially failed: we convinced the population, but we didn&rsquo;t
manage to convince the elites, so now let&rsquo;s convince the
elites.&rdquo; You know, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go talk to the strategic
analysts, who are confused&mdash;they don&rsquo;t understand what we
understand&mdash;and we&rsquo;ll explain to them why a nuclear freeze
would be a good thing.&rdquo; And in fact, that&rsquo;s the direction
a lot of the disarmament movement took after that: the people went
off and got themselves MacArthur Fellowships and so on, and then they
went around &ldquo;convincing&rdquo; the strategic analysts.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">5</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
one of the ways in which you can kid yourself into believing that
you&rsquo;re still doing your work, when really you&rsquo;re being
bought off&mdash;because there&rsquo;s nothing that elites like
better than saying, &ldquo;Oh, come convince me.&rdquo; That stops
you from organizing, and getting people involved, and causing
disruption, because now you&rsquo;re talking to some elite smart
guy&mdash;and you can do that forever: any argument you can give in
favor of it, he can give an argument against it, and it just keeps
going. And also, you get respectable, and you&rsquo;re invited to
lunch at the Harvard Faculty Club, and everybody pays attention to
you and loves you, and it&rsquo;s all great. That&rsquo;s in fact the
direction in which the nuclear freeze movement went&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
a mistake. And we ought to be aware of those mistakes and learn from
them: if you&rsquo;re getting accepted in elite circles, chances are
very strong that you&rsquo;re doing something wrong&mdash;I mean, for
very simple reasons. Why should they have any respect for people who
are trying to undermine their power? It doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8646_2032848809"></a>Awareness
and Actions<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: A lot of the
activists I work with operate under the assumption that if we can
just make people aware, everything&rsquo;s going to work out and
there&rsquo;ll be a change. Even with c.d. [civil disobedience]
actions protesting nuclear weapons, that&rsquo;s been my assumption
too: get people to see us doing it, hold up our signs. But it seems
like that&rsquo;s not all that is needed, really&mdash;what more,
would you say, besides education?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Education is just
the beginning&mdash;and furthermore, there are situations where you
can get everybody aware and on your side, and they still won&rsquo;t
be able to do anything. Like, take a look at Haiti. I don&rsquo;t
think there&rsquo;s much doubt about what 90 percent of the
population there wants, and they&rsquo;re aware of it&mdash;they just
can&rsquo;t do anything about it without getting slaughtered. So
there&rsquo;s a whole series of things which have to happen, and they
 <i>begin</i> with awareness; you don&rsquo;t do anything without
awareness, obviously&mdash;you don&rsquo;t do anything unless you&rsquo;re
aware that there&rsquo;s something that ought to be done, so that&rsquo;s
the beginning almost by definition. But real awareness in fact comes
about through practice and experience with the world. It&rsquo;s not,
first you become aware and <i>then</i> you start doing things; you
become aware <i>through</i> doing things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance, you
become aware of the limits of reformist politics by trying it. In my
view, you should always push all of the opportunities to their
limits&mdash;partly because sometimes you can get some useful results
that help people, but primarily because pretty soon you&rsquo;ll find
out what those limits <i>are</i>, and you&rsquo;ll understand <i>why</i>
there are limits; you&rsquo;ll gain awareness you can&rsquo;t gain
from a lecture. I mean, you can hear all the lectures you like about
the way that power works, but you learn it very fast when you
actually confront it, without the lectures. So there&rsquo;s an
interaction between awareness and action&mdash;and sometimes the
steps you have to take to make changes require taking things to the
level of violent revolutionary struggle. Like, if people in Haiti
were in a position to overthrow the military there by force, in my
opinion they ought to do it. Sometimes it comes to that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As to the c.d.
demonstrations about nuclear weapons, just personally speaking, I had
a lot of disagreements with some of my friends on that, people I
really respect a lot, like the people in Plowshares [a group active
on disarmament issues]. I mean, I think these are all tactical
questions&mdash;like, I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any question
of principle involved in whether you should smash a missile nose-cone
or not, it&rsquo;s not like a contract between you and God or
something. The question is, what are the effects? And there I thought
the effects were negative. It seemed to me that the effects of what
they were doing were, first of all, to remove <i>them</i> from
political action, because they were going to be in jail for twenty
years, and also to tie up tons of money and effort in courts, which
is absolutely the worst place to be. I mean, the worst waste of time
and effort and money in the world is a court&mdash;so any time you
can stay out of courts, you&rsquo;re well off. But the second thing
is, I don&rsquo;t think that they reached people&mdash;because they
didn&rsquo;t prepare the ground for it. Like, if you smash up a
missile nose-cone in some town where people are working at the
missile plant and there&rsquo;s no other way they can make a living,
and they haven&rsquo;t heard of any reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t
have missiles, that doesn&rsquo;t educate anybody, it just gets them
mad at you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So I think these
tactical questions have to be very carefully thought through&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t really predict with much certainty, but as well as you
can, you have to make a guess as to what the effect of the tactic is
going to be. If the effect is going to be to build up awareness,
that&rsquo;s good. But of course, awareness is only the beginning,
because people can be aware and still not do anything&mdash;for
instance, maybe they&rsquo;re afraid they&rsquo;ll lose their jobs.
And obviously you can&rsquo;t criticize people for worrying about
that; they&rsquo;ve got kids, they&rsquo;ve got to live. That&rsquo;s
fair enough. It&rsquo;s hard to struggle for your rights&mdash;you
usually suffer.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8648_2032848809"></a>Leaders
and Movements<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: As an
activist, I think we also have an obligation to get across the fact
that we have fun doing this&mdash;that we get nurtured by working on
these issues which are close to our essence. If we&rsquo;re looking
to the long term, and building up the types of institutions you&rsquo;re
talking about, we have to project that a lot more than we do, almost
as a way of recruitment. Too often, people&rsquo;s image of &ldquo;the
activist&rdquo; is of someone who&rsquo;s always burned out. We have
to create a culture that is engaging to people and exciting, so that
it doesn&rsquo;t just seem like we&rsquo;re putting in the hours and
chanting radical slogans.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, I think the
people who&rsquo;ve really made social movements successful have been
the ones who <i>did</i> those things. They&rsquo;re gone from history
of course: none of the books mention them, nobody knows the names of
the people who really made the social movements in history work&mdash;but
that&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s always happened, I think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And this is even
true of the recent ones, like the anti-war movement in the 1960s. So
there are a lot of books coming out these days that tell you what
went on in the S.D.S. [Students for a Democratic Society] office, or
what one smart guy said to some other smart guy&mdash;but none of
that had anything to do with why the peace movement in the Sixties
became a huge mass movement. From my own personal experience in it,
and that&rsquo;s only a little piece of it obviously, I know who was
doing the <i>really</i> important things, and I remember them&mdash;like,
I remember that this student worked hard to set up that
demonstration, and that&rsquo;s why I had a chance to talk there; and
they were bringing other people in to get involved; they were
enjoying what they were doing, and communicating that to others
somehow. That&rsquo;s what makes popular movements work&mdash;but of
course, that&rsquo;s all going to be gone from history: what will be
left in history is just the fluff on the top.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I&rsquo;m
curious what you think about some of the more famous leaders of
change&mdash;like Martin Luther King or Mahatma Gandhi, for instance.
You don&rsquo;t ever seem to mention them when you speak. Why is
that?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, let&rsquo;s
take Martin Luther King. See, I think Martin Luther King was an
important person, but I do not think that he was a big agent of
change. In fact, I think Martin Luther King was able to play a role
in bringing about change only because the <i>real</i> agents of
change were doing a lot of work. And the real agents of change were
people working at the grassroots level, like S.N.C.C. [Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee] activists, for example.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, part of the
whole technique of disempowering people is to make sure that the real
agents of change fall out of history, and are never recognized  in
the culture for what they are. So it&rsquo;s necessary to distort
history and make it look as if Great Men did everything&mdash;that&rsquo;s
part of how you teach people they can&rsquo;t do anything, they&rsquo;re
helpless, they just have to wait for some Great Man to come along and
do it for them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But just take a look
at the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, for example&mdash;take,
say, Rosa Parks [who triggered the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott
protesting racial segregation]. I mean, the <i>story</i> about Rosa
Parks is, this courageous black woman suddenly decided, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had enough, I&rsquo;m not going to sit in the back of the bus.&rdquo;
Well, that&rsquo;s sort of half true&mdash;but only half. Rosa Parks
came out of a community, a well-organized community, which in fact
had Communist Party roots if you trace it back, things like
Highlander School [a Tennessee school for educating political
organizers] and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">6</font></sup>
But it was a community of people who were working together and had
decided on a plan for breaking through the system of segregation&mdash;Rosa
Parks was just an agent of that plan.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, that&rsquo;s
all out of history. What&rsquo;s in history is, one person had the
courage to do something&mdash;which she did. But not on her own.
Nobody does anything on their own. Rosa Parks came out of an
organized community of committed people, people who&rsquo;d been
working together for change for a very long time. And that&rsquo;s
how it always works.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The same was true of
Martin Luther King: he was able to appear and give public speeches
because S.N.C.C. workers and Freedom Riders and others had prepared
the ground&mdash;and taken a brutal beating for it. And a lot of
those people were pretty privileged kids, remember: they <i>chose</i>
it, they didn&rsquo;t have to do it. <i>They&rsquo;re</i> the Civil
Rights Movement. Martin Luther King was important because he could
stand up there and get the cameras, but these other people were the
real Civil Rights Movement. I&rsquo;m sure he would have said the
same thing too, incidentally&mdash;or at least, he should have.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As for Gandhi, again
it&rsquo;s the same story. He had a very mixed record, actually&mdash;but
the point is, it was the people on the ground who did the work that
prepared the basis for Gandhi to become prominent, and sort of
articulate things. And when you look at any other popular movement, I
think it&rsquo;s always like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8650_2032848809"></a>Levels
of Change<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, as we
work to build up that kind of movement, what do you think are the
best methods we should be using as pressure tactics right now? Should
we be doing the traditional reformist kind of steps&mdash;lobbying
legislators, writing letters, trying to get Democrats into office&mdash;or
should we go with more of a direct action kind of approach,
demonstrations and civil disobedience and so on?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, those are
tactical decisions <i>you</i> have to make&mdash;the only people
qualified to make that kind of decision are the ones who live in a
place, and can see what&rsquo;s going on. So really it would be
ridiculous for me to have an opinion on it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Demonstrations are
often the right thing to do, you just have to make tactical
decisions&mdash;but keep in mind, they&rsquo;re just as reformist as
lobbying your legislature. And there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with that.
I mean, even if you&rsquo;re the most extreme revolutionary in the
world, you&rsquo;re going to use whatever methods are available to
try to ameliorate things, and then if ultimately you run into limits
where powerful institutions will not permit more reform, well, then
you go beyond it. But first you have to reach those limits&mdash;and
there are many ways of reaching them. One way is lobbying your
legislator, one may be another political party, others are
demonstrations&mdash;which simply change the conditions under which
powerful people make decisions. But that does have an effect.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Let me just give you
an example. There&rsquo;s a part of the <i>Pentagon Papers</i> [the
leaked official Defense Department planning record of U.S.
involvement in Vietnam] which is considered politically incorrect&mdash;it
doesn&rsquo;t appear in big histories and nobody discusses it,
because it&rsquo;s just too revealing. It&rsquo;s the part that deals
with the time right after the Tet Offensive. Right after the Tet
Offensive in 1968, everyone recognized that the Vietnam War was going
to take a long time, it wasn&rsquo;t going to be possible to win it
quickly&mdash;so major decisions had to be made about strategy and
policy. Well, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were asked by General
Westmoreland, the top American commander in Vietnam, to send 200,000
more troops over to the war&mdash;and they refused, they didn&rsquo;t
want to do it. And the reason is, they said they were afraid they
might have to use the troops here in the United States to put down a
civil war: they said they were going to need the troops at home for
&ldquo;civil disorder control,&rdquo; as they put it, and therefore
they didn&rsquo;t want to send them to Vietnam.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">7</font></sup>
These guys thought the society was going to crack up in 1968, because
people here were just too opposed to what they were doing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, the &ldquo;civil
disorder&rdquo; was also one of the reasons why a group called the
&ldquo;Wise Men&rdquo; came to Washington with a lot of money in
their pockets, and shortly after, in an unusually blatant power-play,
essentially told President Johnson, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re through:
you&rsquo;re not running for reelection.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">8</font></sup>
And he didn&rsquo;t. We started withdrawing from Vietnam, and we
entered into peace negotiations, and so on. Well, a lot of public
protest here and huge demonstrations and direct actions were a big
part of the reason behind that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, yes,
demonstrations and resistance can have effects&mdash;but they&rsquo;re
no more revolutionary than talking to your legislator. They don&rsquo;t
affect power, they don&rsquo;t change the institutions of power, they
just change the decisions that will be made <i>within</i> those
institutions. And that&rsquo;s a fine thing to do. There&rsquo;s
nothing wrong with that, it helps a lot of people. I mean, I don&rsquo;t
 think the institutions of power should exist either, but that&rsquo;s
another question for right now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What would
you say are the most important causes for us to be focusing on,
then&mdash;I mean, what do you think can actually be done by
activists working today?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, everything can
be done&mdash;everything can be done up to the point of eliminating
all structures of authority and repression: they&rsquo;re human
institutions, they can be dismantled. If you ask what&rsquo;s most
important at this point&mdash;well, you know, that&rsquo;s not the
kind of thing you just decide right on the spot, those are decisions
that come by serious thought and discussion in groups like this,
among people who are really trying to institute change.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, you have to
start with where the world is. Like, you don&rsquo;t start by saying,
&ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s overthrow transnational
corporations&rdquo;&mdash;because right now it&rsquo;s just not
within range. So you start by saying, &ldquo;Look, here&rsquo;s where
the world is, what can we begin to do?&rdquo; Well, you can begin to
do things which will get people to understand better what the real
source of power is, and just how much they can achieve if they get
involved in political activism. And once you&rsquo;ve broken through
the pretense, you just construct organizations&mdash;that&rsquo;s it.
You work on the things that are worth working on. If it&rsquo;s
taking control of your community, it&rsquo;s that. If it&rsquo;s
gaining control of your workplace, it&rsquo;s that. If it&rsquo;s
working on solidarity, it&rsquo;s that. If it&rsquo;s taking care of
the homeless, it&rsquo;s that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">With regard to the
domestic scene, take the fact that the criminal justice system
increasingly is becoming a system for targeting the poor and
minorities, who are being turned into people under military
occupation. Look, that&rsquo;s an easy one to change&mdash;you really
just have to change public opinion on that one. You aren&rsquo;t
striking at the core of private power when you begin to have a
civilized criminal justice system instead of a brutal, barbaric one.
So that&rsquo;s an example of something I think is changeable. Or you
could start by getting us to stop torturing people in the Third
World, right? Easy things to do are, stop killing children in Cuba,
stop massacring people in East Timor, get people in the United States
to realize that Palestinians are human beings&mdash;those are easy
things. So let&rsquo;s do those, first do the easy things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On things like
what&rsquo;s taking place in the international economy, you&rsquo;re
getting into harder territory&mdash;because there, crucial interests
of authoritarian institutions are at stake. And at that point, you&rsquo;re
going to have to face the fact, which sooner or later we&rsquo;re
going to have to face after all, that maybe the most totalitarian
institution in human history&mdash;or certainly close to it&mdash;is
a corporation: it&rsquo;s a centrally-managed institution in which
authority is structured strictly from top to bottom, control is in
the hands of owners and investors, if you&rsquo;re inside the
organization you take orders from above and transmit them down, if
you&rsquo;re outside it there are only extremely  weak popular
controls, which indeed are fast eroding. And this isn&rsquo;t some
new insight of mine, incidentally&mdash;for example, it was pointed
out by Thomas Jefferson in his later years, which were only the early
days of corporations. Jefferson warned that if power was going to
shift into the hands of what he called &ldquo;banking institutions
and moneyed incorporations,&rdquo; then the democratic experiment
would be over: we&rsquo;d have a form of absolutism worse than what
the colonists had struggled against.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">9</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, Thomas
Jefferson is not exactly a figure who&rsquo;s off the mainstream
spectrum in American history, so this is not some new off-the-wall
insight&mdash;it&rsquo;s as American as apple pie, and we should
recognize what Thomas Jefferson could see. But when you do recognize
it, you realize it&rsquo;s a hard nut to crack&mdash;because these
are <i>enormous</i> agglomerations of power, indeed concentrating,
and indeed transnational, which are almost totally protected from
public scrutiny and popular participation. And that&rsquo;s just got
to change.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">After all, why do
corporations have the rights they do? Why are they treated as
&ldquo;immortal persons,&rdquo; contrary to the warnings of people
like Adam Smith and others?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">10</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s not by nature&mdash;in fact, these rights weren&rsquo;t
even granted by Congress, this happened because of decisions made in
courts by judges and lawyers, which simply changed the world
totally.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">11</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, if you ask what
should be done: well, I don&rsquo;t think any sane human being can
look around at the world and not figure out things that have to be
done&mdash;take a walk through the streets, you&rsquo;ll find plenty
of things that have to be done. So you know, you get started doing
them. But you&rsquo;re not going to be able to do them alone. Like,
if you take a walk down the streets and say, &ldquo;That ought to be
done,&rdquo; nothing&rsquo;s going to happen. On the other hand, if
people become organized enough to act together, yeah, then you can
achieve things. And there&rsquo;s no particular limit to what you can
achieve. I mean, that&rsquo;s why we don&rsquo;t still have slavery.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Could you
mention some specific organizations that we could try to link up with
and network with, which are doing a good job of working on these
problems?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, a lot of
organizations are involved, from a lot of different points of view.
For example, at one level&mdash;which is important, though of course
superficial&mdash;Ralph Nader&rsquo;s Public Citizen is involved [the
group works primarily on consumer issues]. That&rsquo;s important,
like I say, but not really touching the basic structure of power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Beyond that, if the
American labor movement ever recovers the insights that ordinary
working people had a hundred years ago, then it will be working on
them too. So if you look back a hundred years&mdash;and even much
more recently than that, in fact&mdash;you&rsquo;ll find that the
major goal of the labor movement in the United States was achieving
industrial democracy: placing the workplace under democratic
control.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">12</font></sup>
And it wasn&rsquo;t because they&rsquo;d  read Marx&mdash;people
figured that out for themselves long before Marx: it was just the
natural response to industrial capitalism. And in fact, Marx didn&rsquo;t
say much about it anyway. So it could be the labor movement that&rsquo;s
doing it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But there&rsquo;s a
ton of activism going on around the country apart from that&mdash;and
though right now it&rsquo;s focused on pretty narrow issues,
ultimately the people are all talking about the same thing:
illegitimate authority of one form or another. I mean, if you want a
list of organizations to contact, it&rsquo;s easy to find&mdash;just
write to any of the major progressive funding organizations, like
Resist in Boston, for example, and they&rsquo;ll be delighted to give
you a list of the couple hundred groups they&rsquo;ve funded in the
last few years: you&rsquo;ll find among them groups involved in any
political cause you can imagine.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">13</font></sup>
Also, in any major city there&rsquo;s typically some church which is
a coordinating center for all kinds of peace and justice
activities&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll find anything in the world there.
That happens everywhere, and they&rsquo;ll be thrilled if you help
direct people to them.</p>

<font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt"><b><i>Non-Violence</i> </b></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Mr. Chomsky,
I&rsquo;ve always hoped we could disassemble corporate capitalism
through non-violent yet very determined and organized resistance, and
the creation of alternative institutions that could someday take over
and diffuse power peacefully. I&rsquo;m wondering, do you think that
kind of hope for non-violence is at all realistic&mdash;and how do
you feel about the use of violence in general?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, like I say,
nobody really knows anything much about tactics&mdash;at least I
don&rsquo;t. But I think you have to think through the non-violence
question in detail. I mean, anybody is going to try to do things
non-violently if possible: what&rsquo;s the point of violence? But
when you begin to encroach on power, you may find that it&rsquo;s
necessary to defend your rights&mdash;and defense of your rights
sometimes does require violence, then either you use it or you don&rsquo;t,
depending on your moral values.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So take a look at
American labor history. Around the first half of this century,
hundreds of American workers were simply killed by security forces,
just for trying to organize.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">14</font></sup>
The United States has an unusually violent labor history, so violent
in fact that if you read the right-wing British press in the
1890s&mdash;the <i>right-wing</i> British press, like the London
<i>Times</i>&mdash;they just couldn&rsquo;t understand the brutality
of the treatment of American workers and their lack of rights.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">15</font></sup>
And it&rsquo;s not because the <i>workers</i> were trying to be
violent&mdash;it&rsquo;s because people with power were violently
protecting their power against people trying to get elementary
rights.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, if you&rsquo;re
a pacifist or something, you have to ask yourself some questions at
that point: are people allowed to defend themselves by force  when
they&rsquo;re attacked by force? Well, okay, people&rsquo;s values
may differ on that, but those are at least the questions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">My own opinion is
that popular movements should try a lot of tactics, but even things
that are non-violent on their face could <i>become</i> violent. For
example, one thing that I think is important is the building of a
political party which could enter the political arena and represent
the population, not just business interests&mdash;I mean, it&rsquo;s
certainly conceivable that there could be a party like that in the
United States. But if such a party ever got any power, people with
power in the society would defend themselves against it. And at that
point everyone&rsquo;s got to decide: do you use violence to protect
your rights or don&rsquo;t you? Look, violence usually comes from the
powerful&mdash;people may talk about it coming from the
revolutionaries, but that&rsquo;s typically because they&rsquo;re
attacked and they then defend themselves with violence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The same question
also arises with another thing that I think has to go on now&mdash;the
building up of alternative media, and of networks of activist
organizations which could help bring people together to fight the
effects of indoctrination, like we&rsquo;ve been talking about.
Again, that&rsquo;s non-violent&mdash;but only up to the point where
it starts to have the effect of undermining corporate power, when
then you may discover that it&rsquo;s not going to be nonviolent
anymore, because the rich may find ways of defending themselves with
violence. So talking about non-violence is easy, but personally I
can&rsquo;t really see taking it as an absolute principle.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, of course,
there are also ways of <i>transcending</i> violence. Like, if enough
people got together and took over a factory, let&rsquo;s say, the
police would try to stop them&mdash;but ultimately the police and
soldiers are just other people, and if understanding and solidarity
were to spread enough, they <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i> stop them. So in a
sense, one answer to your question just has to be more solidarity,
broader solidarity&mdash;so they can&rsquo;t bring in soldiers from
someplace else to smash people up. But that&rsquo;s going to be hard,
we simply have to face that&mdash;it&rsquo;s not just going to happen
on its own. The fact that societies today are so stratified and
divided by hatreds means that elites don&rsquo;t have to go very far
away to bring in people who are willing to repress you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But that can
change&mdash;in fact, it <i>has</i> to change, because there&rsquo;s
a real limit to how much popular movements can defend themselves with
violence and still maintain a popular-democratic character, in my
opinion. To the extent that the defense would require guns and
warfare, I think that any revolutionary developments would probably
decline, and the chance of real changes would likely be destroyed. So
the hope ultimately lies in more international solidarity, I think,
and in the political appeal of what you&rsquo;re doing to other
people in this country, and elsewhere around the world as well.</p>

Capitalism<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Referring
back to your comments about escaping from or doing away with
capitalism, I&rsquo;m wondering what workable scheme you would put in
its place?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Me?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Or what
would you suggest to others who might be in a position to set it up
and get it going?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I think that
what used to be called, centuries ago, &ldquo;wage slavery&rdquo; is
intolerable. I mean, I do not think that people ought to be forced to
rent themselves in order to survive. I think that the economic
institutions ought to be run democratically&mdash;by their
participants, and by the communities in which they live. And I think
that through various forms of free association and federalism, it&rsquo;s
possible to imagine a society working like that. I mean, I don&rsquo;t
think you can lay it out in <i>detail</i>&mdash;nobody&rsquo;s smart
enough to design a society; you&rsquo;ve got to experiment. But
reasonable principles on which to build such a society are quite
clear.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Most efforts
at planned economies kind of go against the grain of democratic
ideals, and founder on those rocks.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it depends
which planned economies you mean. There are lots of planned
economies&mdash;the United States is a planned economy, for example.
I mean, we talk about ourselves as a &ldquo;free market,&rdquo; but
that&rsquo;s baloney. The only parts of the U.S. economy that are
internationally competitive are the planned parts, the
state-subsidized parts&mdash;like capital-intensive agriculture
(which has a state-guaranteed market as a cushion in case there are
excesses); or high-technology industry (which is dependent on the
Pentagon system); or pharmaceuticals (which is massively subsidized
by publicly-funded research). Those are the parts of the U.S. economy
that are functioning well.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">16</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And if you go to the
East Asian countries that are supposed to be the big economic
successes&mdash;you know, what everybody talks about as a triumph of
free-market democracy&mdash;they don&rsquo;t even have the most
remote relation to free-market democracy: formally speaking they&rsquo;re
fascist, they&rsquo;re state-organized economies run in cooperation
with big conglomerates. That&rsquo;s precisely fascism, it&rsquo;s
not the free market.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, that kind of
planned economy &ldquo;works,&rdquo; in a way&mdash;it produces at
least. Other kinds of command economies don&rsquo;t work, or work
differently: for example, the Eastern European planned economies in
the Soviet era were highly centralized, over-bureaucratized, and they
worked very inefficiently, although they did provide a kind of
minimal safety-net for people.  But all of these systems have been
very anti-democratic&mdash;like, in the Soviet Union, there were
virtually no peasants or workers involved in any decision-making
process.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: It would be

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yes, but in the
eighteenth century it would have been hard to find a working model of
a political democracy&mdash;that didn&rsquo;t prove it couldn&rsquo;t
exist. By the nineteenth century, it did exist. Unless you think that
human history is over, it&rsquo;s not an argument to say &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
not around.&rdquo; You go back two hundred years, it was hard to
imagine slavery being abolished.</p>

Kibbutz Experiment<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>ANOTHER MAN: How
could you make decisions democratically without a bureaucracy? I
don&rsquo;t see how a large mass of people could actively participate
in all of the decisions that need to be made in a complex modern
society.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, I don&rsquo;t
think they can&mdash;I think you&rsquo;ve got to delegate some of
those responsibilities. But the question is, where does authority
ultimately lie? I mean, since the very beginnings of the modern
democratic revolutions in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
it&rsquo;s always been recognized that people have to be
represented&mdash;the question is, are we represented by, as they put
it, &ldquo;countrymen like ourselves,&rdquo; or are we represented by
&ldquo;our betters&rdquo;?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">17</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For example, suppose
this was our community, and we wanted to enter into some kind of
arrangement with the community down the road&mdash;if we were fairly
big in scale, we couldn&rsquo;t <i>all</i> do it and get them <i>all</i>
to do it, we&rsquo;d have to delegate the right to negotiate things
to representatives. But then the question is, who has the power to
ultimately authorize those decisions? Well, if it&rsquo;s a
democracy, that power ought to lie not just <i>formally</i> in the
population, but <i>actually</i> in the population&mdash;meaning the
representatives can be recalled, they&rsquo;re answerable back to
their community, they can be replaced. In fact, there should be as
much as possible in the way of constant replacement, so that
political participation just becomes a part of everybody&rsquo;s
life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But I agree, I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s possible to have large masses of people get together
to decide every topic&mdash;it would be unfeasible and pointless.
You&rsquo;re going to want to pick committees to look into things and
report back, and so on and so forth.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">18</font></sup>
But the real question is, where does authority lie?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: It sounds
like the model you&rsquo;re looking to is similar to that of the
kibbutzim [collective farming communities in Israel].</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, the kibbutz is
actually as close to a full democracy as there is, I think. In fact,
I lived on one for a while, and had planned to stay there, for
precisely these reasons. On the other hand, life is full of all kinds
of ironies, and the fact is&mdash;as I have come to understand over
the years even more than I did at one time&mdash;although the
kibbutzim are very authentic democracies internally, there are a lot
of very ugly features about them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For one thing,
they&rsquo;re extremely racist: I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a
single Arab on any kibbutz in Israel, and it turns out that a fair
number of them have been turned down. Like, if a couple forms between
a Jewish member of a kibbutz and an Arab, they generally end up
living in an Arab village. The other thing about them is, they have
an extremely unpleasant relationship with the state&mdash;which I
didn&rsquo;t really know about until fairly recently, even though
it&rsquo;s been that way for a long time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, part of the
reason why the kibbutzim are economically successful is that they get
a substantial state subsidy, and in return for that state subsidy
they essentially provide the officers&rsquo; corps for the elite
military units in Israel. So if you look at who goes into the pilot
training schools and the rangers and all that kind of stuff, it&rsquo;s
kibbutz kids&mdash;that&rsquo;s the trade-off: the government
subsidizes them as long as they provide the Praetorian Guard.
Furthermore, I think they end up providing the Praetorian Guard in
part as a result of kibbutz education. And here there are things that
people who believe in libertarian ideas, as I do, really have to
worry about.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You see, there&rsquo;s
something very authoritarian about the libertarian structure of the
kibbutz&mdash;I could see it when I lived in it, in fact. There&rsquo;s
tremendous group pressure to conform. I mean, there&rsquo;s no force
that <i>makes</i> you conform, but the group pressures are very
powerful. The dynamics of how this worked were never very clear to
me, but you could just see it in operation: the fear of exclusion is
very great&mdash;not exclusion in the sense of not being allowed into
the dining room or something, but just that you won&rsquo;t be a part
of things somehow. It&rsquo;s like being excluded from a family: if
you&rsquo;re a kid and your family excludes you&mdash;like maybe they
let you sit at the table, but they don&rsquo;t talk to you&mdash;that&rsquo;s
devastating, you just can&rsquo;t survive it. And something like that
carries over into these communities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I&rsquo;ve never
heard of anybody studying it, but if you watch the kids growing up,
you can understand <i>why</i> they&rsquo;re going to go into the
rangers and the pilot programs and the commandos. There&rsquo;s a
tremendous macho pressure, right from the very beginning&mdash;you&rsquo;re
just no good unless you can go through Marine Corps training and
become a really tough bastard. And that starts pretty early, and I
think the kids go through real traumas if they can&rsquo;t do it:
it&rsquo;s psychologically very difficult.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the results are
striking. For example, there&rsquo;s a movement of resisters in
Israel [Yesh G&rsquo;vul], people who won&rsquo;t serve in the
Occupied Territories&mdash;but it doesn&rsquo;t have any kibbutz kids
in it: the movement just doesn&rsquo;t exist there. Kibbutz kids also
have a reputation for being what are called &ldquo;good
soldiers&rdquo;&mdash;which means, you know, not nice people: do what
you gotta do.  All of these things are other aspects of it, and the
whole phenomenon comes pretty much without force or authority, but
because of a dynamics of conformism that&rsquo;s extremely powerful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Like, the kibbutz I
lived in was made up of pretty educated people&mdash;they were German
refugees, and a lot of them had university degrees and so on&mdash;but
every single person in the whole kibbutz read the same newspaper. And
the idea that you might read a different newspaper&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s
not that there was a law against it, it was just that it couldn&rsquo;t
be done: you&rsquo;re a member of <i>this</i> branch of the kibbutz
movement, that&rsquo;s the newspaper you read.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Then how can
we build a social contract which is cooperative in nature, but at the
same time recognizes individual humanity? It seems to me that there&rsquo;s
always going to be a very tense polar pull there.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Where&rsquo;s the
polar pull&mdash;between what and what?</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I guess I don&rsquo;t
see why there has to be any contradiction there at all. It seems to
me that a crucial aspect of humanity is being a part of functioning
communities&mdash;so if we can create social bonds in which people
find satisfaction, we&rsquo;ve done it: there&rsquo;s no
contradiction.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, you can&rsquo;t
really figure out what problems are going to arise in group
situations unless you experiment with them&mdash;it&rsquo;s like
physics: you can&rsquo;t just sit around and think what the world
would be like under such and such conditions, you&rsquo;ve got to
experiment and learn how things actually work out. And one of the
things I think you learn from the kibbutz experiment is that you can
in fact construct quite viable and successful democratic
structures&mdash;but there are still going to be problems that come
along. And one of the problems that people just have to face is the
effect of group pressures to conform.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think everybody
knows about this from families. Living in a family is a crucial part
of human life, you don&rsquo;t want to give it up. On the other hand,
there plainly are problems that go along with it&mdash;nobody has to
be told that. And a serious problem, which becomes almost
pathological when it arises in a close-knit group, is exclusion&mdash;and
to avoid exclusion often means doing things you wouldn&rsquo;t want
to do if you had your own way. But that&rsquo;s just a part of
living, to be faced with human problems like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, I&rsquo;m
not a great enthusiast of Marx, but one comment he made seems
appropriate here. I&rsquo;m quoting, so pardon the sexist language,
but somewhere or other he said: socialism is an effort to try to
solve man&rsquo;s <i>animal</i> problems, and after having solved the
animal problems, then we can face the <i>human</i> problems&mdash;but
it&rsquo;s not a part of socialism to solve the  human problems;
socialism is an effort to get you to the point where you can <i>face</i>
the human problems. And I think the kind of thing you&rsquo;re
concerned about is a human problem&mdash;and those are going to be
there. Humans are very complicated creatures, and have lots of ways
of torturing themselves in their inter-personal relations. Everybody
knows that, without soap operas.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8656_2032848809"></a>&ldquo;Anarchism&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Libertarianism&rdquo;<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Professor
Chomsky, on a slightly different topic, there&rsquo;s a separate
meaning of the word &ldquo;anarchy&rdquo; different from the one you
often talk about&mdash;namely, &ldquo;chaos.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, it&rsquo;s a
bum rap, basically&mdash;it&rsquo;s like referring to Soviet-style
bureaucracy as &ldquo;socialism,&rdquo; or any other term of
discourse that&rsquo;s been given a second meaning for the purpose of
ideological warfare. I mean, &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; is a meaning of the
word, but it&rsquo;s not a meaning that has any relevance to social
thought. Anarchy as a social philosophy has never meant &ldquo;chaos&rdquo;&mdash;in
fact, anarchists have typically believed in a highly organized
society, just one that&rsquo;s organized democratically from below.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: It seems
to me that as a social system, anarchism makes such bottom-line sense
that it was necessary to discredit the word, and take it out of
people&rsquo;s whole vocabulary and thinking&mdash;so you just have a
reflex of fear when you hear it.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, anarchism has
always been regarded as the ultimate evil by people with power. So in
Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s Red Scare [a 1919 campaign against
&ldquo;subversives&rdquo; in the U.S.], they were harsh on
socialists, but they murdered anarchists&mdash;they were really bad
news.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, the idea that
people could be free is extremely frightening to anybody with power.
That&rsquo;s why the 1960s have such a bad reputation. I mean,
there&rsquo;s a big literature about the Sixties, and it&rsquo;s
mostly written by intellectuals, because they&rsquo;re the people who
write books, so naturally it has a very bad name&mdash;because they
<i>hated</i> it. You could see it in the faculty clubs at the time:
people were just traumatized by the idea that students were suddenly
asking questions and not just copying things down. In fact, when
people like Allan Bloom [author of <i>The Closing of the American
Mind</i>] write as if the foundations of civilization were collapsing
in the Sixties, from their point of view that&rsquo;s exactly right:
they were. Because the foundations of civilization are, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
a big professor, and I tell you what to say, and what to think, and
you write it down in your notebooks, and you repeat it.&rdquo; If you
get up and say, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand why I should read
Plato, I think it&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s destroying
the foundations of civilization. But maybe it&rsquo;s a  perfectly
sensible question&mdash;plenty of philosophers have said it, so why
isn&rsquo;t it a sensible question?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As with any mass
popular movement, there was a lot of crazy stuff going on in the
Sixties&mdash;but that&rsquo;s the only thing that makes it into
history: the crazy stuff around the periphery. The main things that
were going on are out of history&mdash;and that&rsquo;s because they
had a kind of libertarian character, and there is nothing more
frightening to people with power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What&rsquo;s
the difference between &ldquo;libertarian&rdquo; and &ldquo;anarchist,&rdquo;
exactly?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There&rsquo;s no
difference, really. I think they&rsquo;re the same thing. But you
see, &ldquo;libertarian&rdquo; has a special meaning in the United
States. The United States is off the spectrum of the main tradition
in this respect: what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;libertarianism&rdquo;
here is unbridled capitalism. Now, that&rsquo;s always been opposed
in the European libertarian tradition, where every anarchist has been
a socialist&mdash;because the point is, if you have unbridled
capitalism, you have all kinds of authority: you have <i>extreme</i>
authority.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If capital is
privately controlled, then people are going to have to rent
themselves in order to survive. Now, you can say, &ldquo;they rent
themselves freely, it&rsquo;s a free contract&rdquo;&mdash;but that&rsquo;s
a joke. If your choice is, &ldquo;do what I tell you or starve,&rdquo;
that&rsquo;s not a choice&mdash;it&rsquo;s in fact what was commonly
referred to as wage slavery in more civilized times, like the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, for example.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The American version
of &ldquo;libertarianism&rdquo; is an aberration, though&mdash;nobody
really takes it seriously. I mean, everybody knows that a society
that worked by American libertarian principles would self-destruct in
three seconds. The only reason people pretend to take it seriously is
because you can use it as a weapon. Like, when somebody comes out in
favor of a tax, you can say: &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m a libertarian, I&rsquo;m
against that tax&rdquo;&mdash;but of course, I&rsquo;m still in favor
of the government building roads, and having schools, and killing
Libyans, and all that sort of stuff.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, there <i>are</i>
consistent libertarians, people like Murray Rothbard [American
academic]&mdash;and if you just read the world that they describe,
it&rsquo;s a world so full of hate that no human being would want to
live in it. This is a world where you don&rsquo;t have roads because
you don&rsquo;t see any reason why you should cooperate in building a
road that you&rsquo;re not going to use: if you want a road, you get
together with a bunch of other people who are going to use that road
and you build it, then you charge people to ride on it. If you don&rsquo;t
like the pollution from somebody&rsquo;s automobile, you take them to
court and you litigate it. Who would want to live in a world like
that? It&rsquo;s a world built on hatred.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">19</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The whole thing&rsquo;s
not even worth talking about, though. First of all, it couldn&rsquo;t
function for a second&mdash;and if it could, all you&rsquo;d want to
do is get out, or commit suicide or something. But this is a special
American aberration, it&rsquo;s not really serious.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8658_2032848809"></a>Articulating
Visions<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You often
seem reluctant to get very specific in spelling out your vision of an
anarchist society and how we could get there. Don&rsquo;t you think
it&rsquo;s important for activists to do that, though&mdash;to try to
communicate to people a workable plan for the future, which then can
help give them the hope and energy to continue struggling? I&rsquo;m
curious why you don&rsquo;t do that more often.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I suppose I
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> feel that in order to work hard for social change
you need to be able to spell out a plan for a future society in any
kind of detail. What I feel should drive a person to work for change
are certain <i>principles</i> you&rsquo;d like to see achieved. Now,
you may not know in detail&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t think that any of
us <i>do</i> know in detail&mdash;how those principles can best be
realized at this point in complex systems like human societies. But I
don&rsquo;t really see why that should make any difference: what you
try to do is advance the principles. Now, that may be what some
people call &ldquo;reformism&rdquo;&mdash;but that&rsquo;s kind of
like a put-down: reforms can be quite revolutionary if they lead in a
certain direction. And to push in that direction, I don&rsquo;t think
you have to know precisely how a future society would work: I think
what you have to be able to do is spell out the principles you want
to see such a society realize&mdash;and I think we can imagine <i>many</i>
different ways in which a future society could realize them. Well,
work to help people start trying them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for example, in
the case of workers taking control of the workplace, there are a lot
of different ways in which you can think of workplaces being
controlled&mdash;and since nobody knows enough about what all the
effects are going to be of large-scale social changes, I think what
we should do is try them piecemeal. In fact, I have a rather
conservative attitude towards social change: since we&rsquo;re
dealing with complex systems which nobody understands very much, the
sensible move I think is to make changes and then see what
happens&mdash;and if they work, make further changes. That&rsquo;s
true across the board, actually.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, I don&rsquo;t
feel in a position&mdash;and even if I felt I was, I wouldn&rsquo;t
say it&mdash;to know what the long-term results are going to look
like in any kind of detail: those are things that will have to be
discovered, in my view. Instead, the basic principle I would like to
see communicated to people is the idea that every form of authority
and domination and hierarchy, every authoritarian structure, has to
prove that it&rsquo;s justified&mdash;it has no prior justification.
For instance, when you stop your five-year-old kid from trying to
cross the street, that&rsquo;s an authoritarian situation: it&rsquo;s
got to be justified. Well, in that case, I think you <i>can</i> give
a justification. But the burden of proof for any exercise of
authority is always on the person exercising it&mdash;invariably. And
when you look, most of the time these authority structures have no
justification: they have no moral justification, they have no
justification in the interests of the person lower in the hierarchy,
or in the interests of other  people, or the environment, or the
future, or the society, or anything else&mdash;they&rsquo;re just
there in order to preserve certain structures of power and
domination, and the people at the top.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So I think that
whenever you find situations of power, these questions should be
asked&mdash;and the person who claims the legitimacy of the authority
always bears the burden of justifying it. And if they can&rsquo;t
justify it, it&rsquo;s illegitimate and should be dismantled. To tell
you the truth, I don&rsquo;t really understand anarchism as being
much more than that. As far as I can see, it&rsquo;s just the point
of view that says that people have the right to be free, and if there
are constraints on that freedom then you&rsquo;ve got to justify
them. Sometimes you can&mdash;but of course, anarchism or anything
else doesn&rsquo;t give you the answers about when that is. You just
have to look at the specific cases.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But if we
ever had a society with no wage incentive and no authority, where
would the drive come from to advance and grow?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the drive to
&ldquo;advance&rdquo;&mdash;I think you have to ask exactly what that
means. If you mean a drive to <i>produce more,</i> well, who wants
it? Is that necessarily the right thing to do? It&rsquo;s not
obvious. In fact, in many areas it&rsquo;s probably the wrong thing
to do&mdash;maybe it&rsquo;s a good thing that there wouldn&rsquo;t
be the same drive to produce. People have to be <i>driven</i> to have
certain wants in our system&mdash;why? Why not leave them alone so
they can just be happy, do other things?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Whatever &ldquo;drive&rdquo;
there is ought to be internal. So take a look at kids: they&rsquo;re
creative, they explore, they want to try new things. I mean, why does
a kid start to walk? You take a one-year-old kid, he&rsquo;s crawling
fine, he can get anywhere across the room he likes really fast, so
fast his parents have to run after him to keep him from knocking
everything down&mdash;all of a sudden he gets up and starts walking.
He&rsquo;s terrible at walking: he walks one step and he falls on his
face, and if he wants to really get somewhere he&rsquo;s going to
crawl. So why do kids start walking? Well, they just want to do new
things, that&rsquo;s the way people are built. We&rsquo;re built to
want to do new things, even if they&rsquo;re not efficient, even if
they&rsquo;re harmful, even if you get hurt&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t
think that ever stops.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">People want to
explore, we want to press our capacities to their limits, we want to
appreciate what we can. But the joy of creation is something very few
people get the opportunity to have in our society: artists get to
have it, craftspeople have it, scientists. And if you&rsquo;ve been
lucky enough to have had that opportunity, you know it&rsquo;s quite
an experience&mdash;and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be discovering
Einstein&rsquo;s theory of relativity: anybody can have that
pleasure, even by seeing what <i>other</i> people have done. For
instance, if you read even a simple mathematical proof like the
Pythagorean Theorem, what you study in tenth grade, and you finally
figure out what it&rsquo;s all about, that&rsquo;s exciting&mdash;&ldquo;My
God, I never understood that before.&rdquo; Okay, that&rsquo;s
creativity, even though somebody else proved it two thousand years
ago.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You just keep being
struck by the marvels of what you&rsquo;re discovering, and you&rsquo;re
&ldquo;discovering&rdquo; it, even though somebody else did it
already. Then if you can ever add a little bit to what&rsquo;s
already known&mdash;alright, that&rsquo;s very exciting. And I think
the same thing is true of a person who builds a boat: I don&rsquo;t
see why it&rsquo;s fundamentally any different&mdash;I mean, I wish <i>I</i>
could do that; I can&rsquo;t, I can&rsquo;t imagine doing it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I think people
should be able to live in a society where they can exercise these
kinds of internal drives and develop their capacities freely&mdash;instead
of being forced into the narrow range of options that are available
to most people in the world now. And by that, I mean not only options
that are <i>objectively</i> available, but also options that are
<i>subjectively</i> available&mdash;like, how are people allowed to
think, how are they able to think? Remember, there are all kinds of
ways of thinking that are cut off from us in our society&mdash;not
because we&rsquo;re incapable of them, but because various blockages
have been developed and imposed to prevent people from thinking in
those ways. That&rsquo;s what indoctrination is <i>about</i> in the
first place, in fact&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t mean somebody giving you
lectures: sitcoms on television, sports that you watch, every aspect
of the culture implicitly involves an expression of what a &ldquo;proper&rdquo;
life and a &ldquo;proper&rdquo; set of values are, and that&rsquo;s
all indoctrination.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So I think what has
to happen is, other options have to be opened up to people&mdash;both
subjectively, and in fact concretely: meaning you can do something
about them without great suffering. And that&rsquo;s one of the main
purposes of socialism, I think: to reach a point where people have
the opportunity to decide freely for <i>themselves</i> what their
needs are, and not just have the &ldquo;choices&rdquo; forced on them
by some arbitrary system of power.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8660_2032848809"></a>&ldquo;Want&rdquo;
Creation<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But you
could say that &ldquo;to truck and barter&rdquo; is human nature&mdash;that
people are fundamentally materialist, and will always want to
accumulate more and more under any social structure.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You could <i>say</i>
it, but there&rsquo;s no reason to <i>believe</i> it. You look at
peasant societies, they go on for thousands of years without it&mdash;do
those people have a different human nature? Or just look inside a
family: do people &ldquo;truck and barter&rdquo; over how much you&rsquo;re
going to eat for dinner? Well, certainly a family is a normal social
structure, and you don&rsquo;t see people accumulating more and more
for themselves regardless of the needs of the other people.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, just take a
look at the history of &ldquo;trucking and bartering&rdquo; itself:
look at the history of modern capitalism, about which we know a lot.
The first thing you&rsquo;ll notice is, peasants had to be driven by
force and violence into a wage-labor system they did not want; then
major efforts were undertaken&mdash;conscious  efforts&mdash;to
create wants. In fact, if you look back, there&rsquo;s a whole
interesting literature of conscious discussion of the need to
manufacture wants in the general population. It&rsquo;s happened over
the whole long stretch of capitalism of course, but one place where
you can see it very nicely encapsulated is around the time when
slavery was terminated. It&rsquo;s very dramatic to look at cases
like these.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For example, in 1831
there was a big slave revolt in Jamaica&mdash;which was one of the
things that led the British to decide to give up slavery in their
colonies: after some slave revolts, they basically said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not paying anymore.&rdquo; So within a couple years the British
wanted to move from a slave economy to a so-called &ldquo;free&rdquo;
economy, but they still wanted the basic structure to remain exactly
the same&mdash;and if you take a look back at the parliamentary
debates in England at the time, they were talking very consciously
about all this. They were saying: look, we&rsquo;ve got to keep it
the way it is, the masters have to become the owners, the slaves have
to become the happy workers&mdash;somehow we&rsquo;ve got to work it
all out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there was a
little problem in Jamaica: since there was a lot of open land there,
when the British let the slaves go free they just wanted to move out
onto the land and be perfectly happy, they didn&rsquo;t want to work
for the British sugar plantations anymore. So what everyone was
asking in Parliament in London was, &ldquo;How can we force them to
keep working for us, even when they&rsquo;re no longer enslaved into
it?&rdquo; Alright, two things were decided upon: first, they would
use state force to close off the open land and prevent people from
going and surviving on their own. And secondly, they realized that
since all these workers didn&rsquo;t really <i>want</i> a lot of
things&mdash;they just wanted to satisfy their basic needs, which
they could easily do in that tropical climate&mdash;the British
capitalists would have to start creating a whole set of wants for
them, and make them start desiring things they didn&rsquo;t then
desire, so then the only way they&rsquo;d be able to satisfy their
new material desires would be by working for wages in the British
sugar plantations. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">20</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There was very
conscious discussion of the need to create wants&mdash;and in fact,
extensive efforts were then undertaken to do exactly what they do on
T.V. today: to create wants, to make you want the latest pair of
sneakers you don&rsquo;t really need, so then people will be driven
into a wage-labor society. And that pattern has been repeated over
and over again through the whole entire history of capitalism.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">21</font></sup>
In fact, what the whole history of capitalism shows is that people
have had to be <i>driven</i> into situations which are then claimed
to be their nature. But if the history of capitalism shows anything,
it shows it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> their nature, that they&rsquo;ve had
to be forced into it, and that that effort has had to be maintained
right until this day.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8662_2032848809"></a>Dissidents:
Ignored or Vilified<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, if I
can just change the topic a bit. You&rsquo;ve been called a neo-Nazi,
your books have been burned, you&rsquo;ve been called
anti-Israeli&mdash;don&rsquo;t you get a bit upset by the way that
your views are always distorted by the media and by intellectuals?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, why should I? I
get called anything, I&rsquo;m accused of everything you can dream
of: being a Communist propagandist, a Nazi propagandist, a pawn of
freedom of speech, an anti-Semite, liar, whatever you want.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">22</font></sup>
Actually, I think that&rsquo;s all a good sign. I mean, if you&rsquo;re
a dissident, typically you&rsquo;re ignored. If you can&rsquo;t be
ignored, and you can&rsquo;t be answered, you&rsquo;re
vilified&mdash;that&rsquo;s obvious: no institution is going to help
people undermine it. So I would only regard the kinds of things
you&rsquo;re talking about as signs of progress.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And in fact, it&rsquo;s
gotten a lot better since the 1960s. Again, we don&rsquo;t
remember&mdash;younger people, in particular, don&rsquo;t
appreciate&mdash;just how much it&rsquo;s changed. Let me just give
you an illustration. Boston&rsquo;s a pretty liberal city, and the
first major anti-Vietnam War action there was in October 1965, the
&ldquo;International Days of Protest,&rdquo; it was called. There was
a public demonstration on the Boston Common&mdash;which is like Hyde
Park, Union Square, it&rsquo;s where you give talks&mdash;and I was
supposed to be one of the speakers. Well, the meeting was completely
broken up: we never said one word. There were thousands of
counter-demonstrators, mostly students marching over from the
universities&mdash;and I was very pleased that there were hundreds of
cops there, otherwise we would have been lynched.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The media were just
irate about the demonstration. The front page of the <i>Boston Globe</i>
had a big picture of a wounded war veteran on it, and the rest of the
page was all condemnations of these people who dared to get up and
say that we shouldn&rsquo;t bomb North Vietnam. All of the radio
programs were deluged with denunciations of these Communists and
traitors. The liberals in Congress denounced the &ldquo;utter
irresponsibility&rdquo; of the demonstrators, who were questioning
the right of the United States to bomb North Vietnam&mdash;this was
in 1965.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">23</font></sup>
Incidentally, I should say that those demonstrations were so tepid
it&rsquo;s embarrassing even to think about them&mdash;we weren&rsquo;t
even criticizing the attack on <i>South</i> Vietnam, which was much
worse, we were only talking about the extension of the bombing to the
North.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The next big
demonstration was in March &rsquo;66, that was the second
International Days of Protest. We figured there was no point in
having a public demonstration, because we&rsquo;d get killed, and we
didn&rsquo;t want to have it at a university because the university
would probably get smashed to dust, so we decided to have it in a
church. So there was a march from Harvard Square down to the
Arlington Street Church in downtown Boston, the Unitarian Church
which was kind of the center of the movement activities, and the
march was pretty well protected&mdash;guys on motorcycles were
driving up and back trying to keep people from getting slaughtered
and so on. Finally we got down to the church and went in: the church
was attacked&mdash;there were big mobs outside throwing projectiles,
tomatoes, cans. I mean, the police were <i>there</i>, and they were
preventing people from getting killed, but they weren&rsquo;t doing
much more than that. That was in 1966.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There&rsquo;s been a
big change since then&mdash;a big, big change. All of that stuff is
<i>inconceivable</i> today, absolutely inconceivable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What I&rsquo;m
struck with in each of the three major misunderstandings that are
used against you&mdash;the Faurisson affair [Chomsky made public
statements in 1979 and &rsquo;80 that a French professor who denied
the Holocaust should not be jailed for his writings by the French
government, and was denounced as a defender of the man&rsquo;s views
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">24</font></sup>], your
statements about Cambodia [Chomsky compared the genocide in Cambodia
to that in East Timor, corrected numerous statistical falsifications
about Cambodia, and was labeled an apologist for Pol Pot <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">25</font></sup>],
and your stance on the Israeli/ Palestinian conflict <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">26</font></sup>&mdash;is
how much your views have been distorted and oversimplified by the
press. I don&rsquo;t understand why you&rsquo;d want to keep bringing
these ideas to the mass media when they always insist on
misrepbringing these ideas to the mass media when they always insist
on misrepresenting them.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But why is that
surprising? First of all, this is not happening in the mass media,
this is happening in the intellectual journals. And intellectuals are
specialists in defamation, they&rsquo;re basically commissars [Soviet
officials responsible for political indoctrination]&mdash;they&rsquo;re
the ideological managers, so they are the ones who feel the most
threatened by dissidence. The mass media don&rsquo;t care that much,
they just ignore it, or say it&rsquo;s crazy or something like that.
In fact, this stuff barely enters the national media; sure, you&rsquo;ll
get a throwaway line saying, &ldquo;this guy&rsquo;s an apologist for
this that and the other thing,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s just feeding
off the intellectual culture. The place where it&rsquo;s really done
is inside the intellectual journals&mdash;because that&rsquo;s their
specialty. They&rsquo;re commissars: it&rsquo;s not fundamentally
different from the Communist Party.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And also, I&rsquo;m
a particular target for other reasons&mdash;a lot of what I write is
a critique of the American liberal intellectual establishment, and
they don&rsquo;t like that particularly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: You also
criticize Israel, right?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, the most
sensitive of these issues has to do with the Middle East. In fact,
there are organizations which are just dedicated to defamation on
that issue. I mean, I didn&rsquo;t even get involved in writing about
the Middle East at first, although that was always my main interest
since childhood, partially for this reason&mdash;because they&rsquo;re
very Stalinist-like, and I knew how they worked from the inside. In
fact, I was one of the people who was doing it when I was a kid; you
sort of get absorbed in this stuff, you know. And they&rsquo;re just
<i>desperate</i> to prevent discussion of the issues.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for example, the
Anti-Defamation League [of B&rsquo;nai B&rsquo;rith], which
masquerades as a civil rights organization, is in fact just a
defamation organization. The office in Boston happens to be a rather
leaky place, and I&rsquo;ve  been leaked a lot of stuff from there by
people working in the office who are just outraged by what goes on.
For instance, they leaked me my file a couple years ago&mdash;it had
hundreds of pages of material, because whenever I speak anywhere,
they&rsquo;ve got a spy working for them who&rsquo;s taking notes and
sending them back to some central office. So somebody will be here,
say, taking notes on what I&rsquo;m saying, and some version of it
will get into my file and then be circulated around to their offices
in the rest of the country: there are intercepted communications, and
fevered inter-office memos, &ldquo;he said so-and-so at
such-and-such&rdquo;&mdash;all kinds of <i>schmutz,</i> as they call
it in my culture [&ldquo;<i>schmutz</i>&rdquo; means &ldquo;dirt&rdquo;
in Yiddish]. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">27</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But if any of you
have ever looked at your F.B.I. file through a Freedom of Information
Act release, you&rsquo;ve probably discovered that intelligence
agencies are in general extremely incompetent&mdash;that&rsquo;s one
of the reasons why there are so many intelligence failures: they just
never get anything straight, for all kinds of reasons. And part of it
is because the information they get typically is being transmitted to
them by agents and informants who are ideological fanatics, and they
always misunderstand things in their own crazy ways. So if you look
at an F.B.I. file where you actually know what the facts are, you&rsquo;ll
usually see that the information has some relation to reality&mdash;you
can sort of figure out what they&rsquo;re talking about&mdash;but by
the time it&rsquo;s worked its way through the ideological fanaticism
of the intelligence system, there&rsquo;s been all sorts of weird
distortion. And that&rsquo;s true of the Anti-Defamation League&rsquo;s
intelligence too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But this stuff
certainly is circulated around&mdash;like, probably somebody in this
area received it from the regional office, and there&rsquo;ll be some
article in the local newspaper tomorrow that&rsquo;ll pull a lot of
junk out of the file, that&rsquo;s what usually happens when I go
places. And the point is that it&rsquo;s used to close off the
discussion: since they can&rsquo;t deal with the issues, they&rsquo;ve
got to close off the discussion&mdash;and the best way to do it is by
throwing enough slime so that maybe people will figure, where there&rsquo;s
smoke there&rsquo;s fire, so we&rsquo;d better not listen.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the A.D.L. is
an organized group where that&rsquo;s their main job.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">28</font></sup>
But there are plenty of others who do the same sort of thing&mdash;because
this is really the institutional task of the whole intellectual
community. I mean, the job of mainstream intellectuals is to serve as
a kind of secular priesthood, to ensure that the doctrinal faith is
maintained. So if you go back to a period when the Church was
dominant, the priesthood did it: they were the ones who watched out
for heresy and went after it. And as societies became more secular in
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the same controls were
needed: the institutions still had to defend themselves, after all,
and if they couldn&rsquo;t do it by burning people at the stake or
sending them to inquisitions anymore, they had to find other ways.
Well, over time that responsibility was transferred to the
intellectual class&mdash;to be guardians of the sacred political
truths, hatchet-men of one sort or another.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you see, as a
dissident, you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to get all of this  stuff
done to you, it&rsquo;s in fact a positive sign&mdash;it means that
you can&rsquo;t just be ignored anymore.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: You&rsquo;re
really not discouraged by the fact that your work almost never gets
portrayed accurately to the public or reviewed in a serious way by
the press?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, not at all&mdash;and
we really <i>shouldn&rsquo;t</i> get discouraged by that kind of
thing. Look, I am not expecting to be applauded by people in
editorial offices and at Faculty Clubs&mdash;that&rsquo;s not my
audience. I mean, I was in India a little while ago and visited rural
self-governing villages, and the people there were happy to see me. I
was in Australia at the invitation of Timorese refugees, and they
were glad that I was trying to help them. Recently I gave talks at a
labor federation in Canada, and I&rsquo;ve done that in the United
States often&mdash;those are the people that I want to talk to,
they&rsquo;re the audience I&rsquo;d like to address.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it&rsquo;s
interesting and worth pointing out that the media in the United
States are different in this respect&mdash;I do get pretty easy
access to national media in other countries. In fact, it&rsquo;s only
in the United States and the old Soviet Empire that I haven&rsquo;t
had any real access to the major media over the years. And it&rsquo;s
not just <i>me</i>, of course: the major media in the U.S., as was
the case in the former Soviet Empire, pretty much exclude <i>anybody</i>
with a dissident voice. So I can have interviews and articles in
major journals and newspapers in Western Europe, and in Australia,
and all up and down the Western Hemisphere. And often I get
invitations from leading journals in other countries to write for
them&mdash;like, recently I had an article in Israel&rsquo;s most
important newspaper, <i>Ha&rsquo;aretz</i>, which is kind of the
equivalent of the <i>New York Times</i>: it was an invited critique
of their foreign policy, and of the so-called &ldquo;peace process.&rdquo;
<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">29</font></sup> Or in
Australia, I gave a talk at the National Press Club in the Parliament
Building, which was nationally televised twice on Australian World
Services, their version of the B.B.C.&mdash;they wanted me to speak
about <i>Australia&rsquo;s</i> foreign policy, so I gave a very
critical talk to a national audience, and I spoke to Parliamentarians
and journalists and so on, and was all over the press and papers
there. And the same thing is true in Europe; I&rsquo;m often on the
C.B.C. nationally in Canada; and so on. Well, as you say, that&rsquo;s
all unheard of in the United States&mdash;and the main reason, I
think, is just that what people think, and are allowed to think, is
much more important here, so the controls are much greater. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">30</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I heard
something vaguely about your books being burned in Canada once. Were
you there? What was that like for you?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That was in Toronto.
Yeah, I was there. I mean, I think people have a right to burn books
if they want. I was in fact interviewed about it, I said the obvious
thing&mdash;I&rsquo;d rather they read them than burn them, but if
they  want to burn them, I don&rsquo;t care. Actually, you don&rsquo;t
really have to worry about burning books&mdash;burning books is
virtually impossible. Books are like bricks: they&rsquo;re very hard
to burn.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Was that a
popular rabble or something? How did it happen?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It was actually
Vietnamese refugees. There&rsquo;s a Vietnamese refugee community
that heard, or decided, or whatever, that I was . . . I don&rsquo;t
know what. It was impossible to find out what they&rsquo;d heard.
They obviously knew that I was against the Vietnam War, and they were
obviously very pro-war&mdash;you know, they thought the Americans
should have stayed in and won it, that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re
Vietnamese refugees. So they burned the books&mdash;which is fine,
it&rsquo;s a reasonable form of protest. Now, if the <i>government</i>
burns books, that&rsquo;s a different story, or if a <i>corporation</i>
burns books, that&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, just as an
aside, I should say that I&rsquo;ve had much worse destruction of
books than that. You know how there&rsquo;s been all this business
all over the front pages recently about big media mega-mergers, and
there&rsquo;s all kinds of thoughtful discussion about whether this
is going to harm the freedom of the press and so on? I really have to
laugh. The first book that Ed Herman and I wrote together was
published in 1974 by a rather profitable textbook publisher which
happened to be owned by Warner Communications. Well, one of the
executives at the corporation [William Sarnoff] didn&rsquo;t like the
advertising copy that he saw about it, and he asked to see the
book&mdash;and he was horrified by the book, and wouldn&rsquo;t let
the publisher distribute it. Then came a long hassle, in which the
people who ran the publishing company tried to insist on their right
to publish, and in the end Warner Communications just put the
publisher out of business, they decided that the easiest way to deal
with the situation was just to terminate them. That meant that not
only was <i>our</i> book destroyed, but <i>everybody&rsquo;s</i>
books were destroyed. That does the Ayatollah one better: that&rsquo;s
way beyond burning a book, that&rsquo;s destroying every book by this
publisher to prevent one particular book, which had already been
printed, from being distributed.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">31</font></sup>
Now, <i>that</i> I would regard as much more serious than a number of
people burning a book for symbolic reasons. If they want to do that,
fine.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: How
significant do you think these media mega-mergers really are in the
end?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the first
chapter of our book <i>Manufacturing Consent</i> does talk a bit
about the corporate concentration of the media&mdash;and that part
actually was written by Ed Herman, who&rsquo;s a specialist in
corporate control; I didn&rsquo;t have anything to do with it. But my
own feeling is that that particular issue is not quite as important
as it&rsquo;s sometimes made out to be. I mean, if there  were fifty
media corporations instead of three, for example, I think they&rsquo;d
do about the same thing they do now&mdash;just because they all have
basically the same interests. Maybe there&rsquo;d be a little bit
more competition, but probably not much. That&rsquo;s my view of the
question, at least.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Have you
ever had your linguistics work censored or impeded in publication
because of your politics?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Never in the United
States&mdash;but in the rest of the world, sure. For instance, I&rsquo;ll
never forget one week, it must have been around 1979 or so, when I
was sent two newspapers: one from Argentina and one from the Soviet
Union. Argentina was then under the rule of these neo-Nazi generals,
and I was sent <i>La Prensa</i> from Buenos Aires, the big newspaper
in Argentina&mdash;there was a big article saying, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
read this guy&rsquo;s linguistics work because it&rsquo;s Marxist and
subversive.&rdquo; The same week I got an article from <i>Izvestia</i>
in the Soviet Union which said, &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t read this
guy&rsquo;s linguistics work because he&rsquo;s idealist and
counter-revolutionary.&rdquo; I thought that was pretty nice.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, aren&rsquo;t
you at all afraid of being silenced by the establishment for being so
prominent and vocal in speaking out against U.S. power and its
abuses?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, not really&mdash;and
for a very simple reason, actually: if you look at me, you&rsquo;ll
see what it is. I&rsquo;m white, I&rsquo;m privileged, and that means
I&rsquo;m basically immune from punishment by power. I mean, I don&rsquo;t
want to say that it&rsquo;s a hundred percent immunity&mdash;but the
fact of the matter is that these two things mean that you can buy a
lot of freedom.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, there isn&rsquo;t
any true capitalist society in the world, it couldn&rsquo;t survive
for ten minutes, but there are variations on capitalism, and the U.S.
is towards the capitalist end of the world spectrum&mdash;not very
far towards it, I should say, but towards it at least in values. And
if you had a truly capitalist society, everything would be a
commodity, including freedom: there would be as much of it as you can
buy. Well, since the U.S. is towards that end of the spectrum, it
means there&rsquo;s an awful lot of freedom around if you can afford
it. So if you&rsquo;re a black organizer in the ghetto, you don&rsquo;t
have much of it, and you&rsquo;re in trouble&mdash;they can send the
Chicago police in to murder you, like they did with Fred Hampton [a
Black Panther assassinated by the F.B.I. in 1969]. But if you&rsquo;re
a white professional like me, you can buy a lot of freedom.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And beyond that, I
also happen to belong to a sector of the society where those who have
real power are going to want to protect me&mdash;I mean, they may
hate everything about me and want to see me disappear, but they don&rsquo;t
want the state to be powerful enough to go after people <i>like</i>
me, because then it could go after people like <i>them.</i> So the
fact of the matter is that in societies  like ours, privileged people
like me are pretty well protected. It&rsquo;s not a hundred percent,
but there&rsquo;s a lot of leeway around.</p>

About Resistance<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Do you
have any thoughts about how best to begin helping people understand
some of these ideas&mdash;like about the media institutions and how
they prevent people from thinking freely for themselves?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I don&rsquo;t
think any of it&rsquo;s very hard, to tell you the honest truth&mdash;I
mean, intellectuals make a career of trying to make simple things
look hard, because that&rsquo;s part of the way you get your salary
paid and so on. But the fact of the matter is, the social world&mdash;to
the extent that we understand it at all&mdash;is more or less right
there in front of you after you sort of peel away the blinders a
little. It&rsquo;s an extremely hard thing to understand if you&rsquo;re
all alone trying to do it, but through the kinds of interactions and
groups we&rsquo;ve been talking about, you can do it pretty easily.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So when you have a
chance to meet with people or talk with them, I think the thing to do
is to try to get them to learn how to explore things for
themselves&mdash;for example, to help them learn for <i>themselves</i>
the way that the media shape and frame issues for the purpose of
manipulation and control. Now, there&rsquo;s not much point in doing
it abstractly&mdash;you know, like some theory of how it works. What
you have to do is look at cases. So take cases that people are
interested in, and just teach them how to do research
projects&mdash;research projects are very easy to do, you don&rsquo;t
need a Ph.D.; maybe in physics you do, but not in these topics. You
just have to have common sense. You have to have common sense, you
have to look carefully at the facts; it may be a little bit of work
to <i>find</i> the facts&mdash;like usually you&rsquo;re not just
going to find them right there in the headlines or something. But if
you do a little work, you can find out what the facts are, you can
find out the way they&rsquo;re being distorted and modified by the
institutions. And then the purposes of those distortions quickly
become clear.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: It&rsquo;s
hard to know the best way to stimulate people&rsquo;s interest as a
teacher or an organizer, but certainly there are ways of not doing
it, even while appearing to do it. Earlier, in response to the
question about civil disobedience, you mentioned people lecturing on
resistance&mdash;that would seem to me to be an example of not doing
it, while pretending to do it.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I&rsquo;m not
so convinced that that&rsquo;s <i>not</i> a way to do it, actually.
Like, I think there are things to teach people about resistance&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
personally liked to listen to people who have had experiences with
it, and who may have ideas about it that I don&rsquo;t have. If you
want to call that &ldquo;lecturing,&rdquo; okay&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
not necessarily wrong: there are lots of things you  can learn from
other people who have thought about subjects and had experiences.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But what I&rsquo;m
wondering is, what else do you think would go into teaching people
about resistance, and activism in general?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First of all I don&rsquo;t
think you should mislead people: you should get them to understand
that if they&rsquo;re going to be independent thinkers, they are
probably going to pay a cost. I mean, one has to begin with an
understanding of the way the world works: the world does not reward
honesty and independence, it rewards obedience and service. It&rsquo;s
a world of concentrated power, and those who have power are not going
to reward people who question that power. So to begin with, I don&rsquo;t
think anybody should be misled about that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">After you understand
that, okay, then you make your own choices. If your choice is that
you want to be independent anyhow, even though you recognize what&rsquo;s
involved, then you should just go ahead and try to do it&mdash;but
those can be extremely hard choices sometimes. For instance, I know
that as an older person who often gets approached by younger people
for advice, I&rsquo;m always very hesitant to give it on these sorts
of decisions (even though sometimes the circumstances are such that I
have to)&mdash;because I&rsquo;m in no position to tell anybody else
what to decide. But what I think one can do is to help people
understand what the objective realities are.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, you can gain a
lot by activism, like all of you were saying earlier&mdash;but there
are also many things that you can lose. And some of those things are
not unimportant, like security for example&mdash;that&rsquo;s not
unimportant. And people just have to make their own choices about
that when they decide what they&rsquo;re going to do.</p>

a personal level for a moment, Noam, I&rsquo;ve always been kind of
fascinated by how you find the time to write books and articles, and
teach, give talks all over the country, have a family life, be the
leading figure in linguistics, you document your work very
thoroughly&mdash;are you in some kind of a time warp, where you
experience something other than a 24-hour day like the rest of us?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, it&rsquo;s just
pure, ordinary fanaticism&mdash;and in fact, a lot of things go.
Anybody who&rsquo;s pretty seriously involved in political activity
or organizing knows that a lot of other things just go, like personal
lives sometimes. I mean, yeah, I try to keep my personal life
going&mdash;so my grandkids and children were over a few nights ago,
and I played with them, that sort of thing. But personal
relationships do suffer. For instance, if I see my closest personal
friends, whom I&rsquo;ve known for fifty years, we&rsquo;re extremely
close and so on, once or twice a year, it&rsquo;s a good year. But
that&rsquo;s the way it goes: you can&rsquo;t do everything, so you
just have to make choices.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, it was
kind of striking to watch it during the Sixties&mdash;all of a sudden
a lot of people really threw themselves into activism, and when I
think about it, very few of the couples made it through. Very few.
Not because they hated each other or anything&mdash;it was just that
it was too much of an emotional burden, even if both of them were
involved, and something snaps. In fact, it was like a tidal wave
right through that period, particularly after some of the big
political trials. So couples would stick together for as long as the
trial was going on, and immediately afterwards get divorced&mdash;it
was just too much. And that&rsquo;s a reflection of what tends to
happen in general when you get really seriously involved.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, it&rsquo;s
extremely hard to lead a deeply committed life in several different
areas and have them all work. Some of them give, and one of the ones
that gives often is personal life&mdash;and that&rsquo;s hard to deal
with, because you just can&rsquo;t go on that way. I don&rsquo;t
really know what the answer is to that, actually; people have found
different answers.</p>

a terrible void&mdash;and it then makes it impossible for you to
work. After all, we&rsquo;re not automata: we function as part of a
matrix of human relations, and need to connect with other people.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: And the
personal isolation then reinforces the political isolation.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s tough,
yeah. I mean, partly the problem is a result of the fact that we&rsquo;re
all so isolated: if we had live, ongoing popular organizations, this
wouldn&rsquo;t be so true. The history of the labor movement in the
United States is interesting in this respect, actually: when people
were really working together organizing, that overcame the isolation.
In fact, it even overcame things like racism and sexism to a great
extent. And this goes way back.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, about a
century ago in the United States, the labor movement was getting
smashed all over the place: they were only defeated, there were no
victories. But in the course of those defeats&mdash;things like, say,
the Homestead strike [an 1892 strike at a Carnegie Steel plant in
Pennsylvania]&mdash;it&rsquo;s amazing what happened. Homestead&rsquo;s
an interesting case, actually, because it was a working-class town,
and the strikers simply took the place over:  they took over the town
and ran everything. And this was during a very racist period,
remember&mdash;there weren&rsquo;t a lot of blacks around right
there, but there was real racism directed at Eastern Europeans. So,
what were called &ldquo;Huns&rdquo; (which could be Slovaks or
anybody, it didn&rsquo;t have to be Hungarians) were treated sort of
the way blacks are treated&mdash;and the racism was very vicious. But
it all collapsed in the middle of the Homestead strike. And also,
women were running all sorts of things too, a lot of the sexism was
broken down as well. And that&rsquo;s what tends to happen when
people join together in common struggles. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">32</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It also happened in
the formation of the C.I.O. [a union for mass-production industries
formed in 1935]&mdash;black and white workers worked together to
create the C.I.O. And it happened in the Civil Rights Movement&mdash;S.
N.C.C., for example, was very open, it was white, black, anything. A
lot of the unpleasant aspects of life disappear, and you can
compensate for them, in the course of some kind of common struggle.
In fact, an old friend of mine who was in the Polish resistance in
Warsaw during the Nazi occupation&mdash;and lived through that time
and survived&mdash;always used to say that it was the best period of
his life. I mean, it was extremely dangerous&mdash;you could end up
in a gas chamber and everybody knew it&mdash;but there was a sense of
community that he&rsquo;d never felt before, and never had after.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the best answer,
I suspect, is just the same as for everything else&mdash;we have to
develop stable popular organizations, and a culture of concern, and
commitment, and activism, and solidarity, which can help to sustain
us in these struggles, and which can help break down some of the
barriers that have been set up to divide and distract us.</p>

and Human Nature<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, could
you elaborate a little more on what your own opinions are about human
nature&mdash;for instance, do you see humans as more destructive than
constructive, or is it maybe the other way around?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, first of all,
my opinion about it is no better than yours: it&rsquo;s just pure
intuition, nobody really understands anything about human nature.
Look, people don&rsquo;t understand much about big molecules&mdash;when
you get beyond that to things like human nature, anybody&rsquo;s
guess is as good as anyone else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But you&rsquo;ve
studied a lot of the results of human nature.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, but if you
look at the results of human nature, you see everything: you see
enormous self-sacrifice, you see tremendous courage, you see
integrity, you see destructiveness, you see anything you want. That
doesn&rsquo;t tell you much.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: It seems
like a great deal of your research documents the destructive nature
of humans, though.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, but a lot of
it documents other things too. I mean, my general feeling is that
over time, there&rsquo;s measurable progress: it&rsquo;s not huge,
but it&rsquo;s significant. And sometimes it&rsquo;s been pretty
dramatic. For instance, take the sort of &ldquo;original sin&rdquo;
of American history&mdash;what happened to the native population
here. It&rsquo;s a remarkable fact that until the 1960s, the culture
simply could not come to terms with that at all. Until the 1960s,
with very rare exceptions, academic scholarship was grossly
falsifying the history, and suppressing the reality of what
happened&mdash;even the number of people killed was radically
falsified. I mean, as late as 1969, in one of the leading diplomatic
histories of the United States, the author Thomas Bailey could write
that after the American Revolution, the former colonists turned to
the task of &ldquo;felling trees and Indians.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">33</font></sup>
<i>Nobody</i> could say that now&mdash;you couldn&rsquo;t even say
that in a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editorial now. Well, those are
important changes, and it&rsquo;s part of a lot of other significant
progress too. Slavery was considered a fine thing not long ago.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: So you think
that human nature is individually kind of destructive, but overall
it&rsquo;s constructive?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;like, they didn&rsquo;t have gas chambers in the
nineteenth century, so you can find all kinds of things. And if you
want to look for scientific answers, it&rsquo;s zilch, nobody knows a
thing: the answers mostly come from history or intuition or
something. I mean, science can only answer very simple questions&mdash;when
things get complicated, you just guess.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>ANOTHER MAN:
People often ask you about the connections between your scientific
work in linguistics and your politics, and you tend to say something
about, &ldquo;Yes, there are a few tenuous connections.&rdquo; Would
you amplify on that? I myself have been thinking that maybe part of
our political problem is that the human brain is very good at seeing
things in competitive terms like &ldquo;more&rdquo; and &ldquo;less,&rdquo;
and it&rsquo;s not very good at conceptualizing &ldquo;enough.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that may be
true&mdash;but these are topics where the scientific study of
language has nothing to say. I mean, you know as much about it as the
fanciest linguist around.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Where are
they, then&mdash;even the tenuous connections?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Not there; the
tenuous connections are somewhere else.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First of all, we
should remember that the kinds of things that any sort of science can
shed light on are pretty narrow: when you start moving to complicated
systems, scientific knowledge declines very fast. And when you get
to the nature of human beings, the sciences have nothing to say.
There are a few areas where you can get a lot of insight and
understanding, and certain aspects of language happen to be one of
those areas, for some reason&mdash;but that insight still doesn&rsquo;t
bear on questions of real human concern, at least not at a level
which has any consequences for human life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The connections are
quite different&mdash;and they <i>are</i> tenuous. The only reason
for stressing them is because they&rsquo;ve been pointed out many
times through the course of modern intellectual history, and in fact
they lie right at the core of classical liberalism. I mean, contrary
to the contemporary version of it, classical liberalism (which
remember was pre-capitalist, and in fact, anti-capitalist) focused on
the right of people to control their own work, and the need for free
creative work under your own control&mdash;for human freedom and
creativity. So to a classical liberal, wage labor under capitalism
would have been considered totally immoral, because it frustrates the
fundamental need of people to control their own work: you&rsquo;re a
slave to someone else.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, in trying to
locate sort of a core in human nature for a right to free, creative
work and control over it, some classical liberal philosophers looked
at other aspects of human intelligence, and one aspect that had
indeed been studied since the seventeenth century, and had a lot to
do with Cartesian thought as well [i.e. after the French philosopher
Descartes], was language&mdash;where it was recognized, quite
accurately, that sort of an identifying criterion of possession of a
mind in the human sense (as distinct from an animal or an automaton)
is the free creative aspect of the normal use of language.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for example, a
central part of Descartes&rsquo; argument for a sharp, even
ontological distinction between humans and everything else in the
world was that if you pose a question to a human being about a new
topic using phrases that the person has never heard before, they can
give you a new response relevant to what you said, which is not
caused by their internal state and not caused by any external
circumstances, but which somehow comes out of some creative capacity
of their mind. But the same thing won&rsquo;t be true of an automaton
or an animal or anything else&mdash;like, if you take a machine and
set it in a certain environment and push a button, what will come out
is predetermined; or if you give a pigeon a certain stimulus, its
actions also are going to be predetermined. But in human language,
the product that comes out is <i>not</i> predetermined&mdash;it&rsquo;s
undetermined, but still somehow appropriate to situations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, to Descartes,
that was the crucial aspect of the human mind. And there was an
attempt right through the classical liberal period, by Rousseau, and
Humboldt, and others, to link up these elements and identify sort of
a need and a right to freedom, an &ldquo;instinct for freedom,&rdquo;
it was sometimes called, something at the cognitive core of human
nature: free creative thought and its expression.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, that&rsquo;s
pretty metaphoric&mdash;like I say, nobody really knows anything
about human nature, so certainly you don&rsquo;t know whether there&rsquo;s
an instinct for freedom or not. I mean, if somebody wants to say that
humans are born to be slaves, they can give as much of a scientific
argument as Rousseau could when he said they&rsquo;re born to be
free&mdash;it&rsquo;s like where your hopes are, it&rsquo;s not that
there&rsquo;s any scientific knowledge.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the same thing
is true today: like, you can read any book you want about
sociobiology [theory that specific social behaviors and not just
physical characteristics result from evolution], and it&rsquo;s
mostly just fairy tales&mdash;I mean, it&rsquo;s all fine when it&rsquo;s
talking about ants; when it goes up to the level of mammals, it
starts being guesswork; and when it gets to humans, it&rsquo;s like,
say anything that comes to your head. But I think you can see a
possible connection of that sort&mdash;a potential connection.
Whether that connection can actually be made substantive, who knows?
It&rsquo;s all so far beyond scientific understanding at this point
that you can&rsquo;t even dream about it. So that&rsquo;s the main
reason why I don&rsquo;t talk about these things much. I just think
they&rsquo;re interesting ideas, which are maybe worth thinking about
in the back of your mind, or maybe writing poems about or something.
But they&rsquo;re simply not topics for scientific inquiry at this
point.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8668_2032848809"></a>Charlatans
in the Sciences<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam,
there&rsquo;s an idea in behavioral science, tied in with Piaget&rsquo;s
theory of cognitive development, that human compassion is a learned
quality [the Swiss psychologist Piaget believed that mental
development in children progresses through four
genetically-determined stages]. Some politicians have seized upon
this idea to promote the death penalty being used more often: like,
either you catch the boat or you don&rsquo;t, either you learn human
compassion or you don&rsquo;t&mdash;so if these murderers haven&rsquo;t
learned it, well, then it&rsquo;s impossible to teach it to them now.
I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re familiar with these arguments?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This stuff doesn&rsquo;t
even rise to the level of idiocy&mdash;literally. I mean, if people
want to have a fraudulent reason for defending the death penalty,
fine, but there is no scientific basis. Take Piaget: Piaget&rsquo;s
work on developmental psychology was interesting, he had some
interesting experiments and so on&mdash;the whole edifice has totally
collapsed, nobody believes a word of it anymore. It turned out that
all of the developmental &ldquo;stages&rdquo; are false: as you got
better experiments, you could show that tiny infants could do all the
things he postulated they couldn&rsquo;t do at that stage. I mean, it
was an interesting set of ideas, it wasn&rsquo;t stupid&mdash;and
people learned from the experimental work. But there&rsquo;s nothing
left of the picture. Zero.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As far as compassion
being learned, any one of you knows as much as the fanciest
scientist&mdash;and what you know is what you know by intuition and
experience: you&rsquo;ve seen children, maybe you&rsquo;ve had
children, you&rsquo;ve  played with them, you see the way they grow
up. That&rsquo;s what anybody knows, nobody knows any more than that.
And the sciences have nothing more to tell you&mdash;and furthermore,
there&rsquo;s no indication that they ever will: it&rsquo;s just way
too far away. I mean, they may give you some statistical evidence, or
maybe someday somebody will be able to show that this kind of
background leads to more compassionate people than some other kind of
background, that&rsquo;s entirely possible. But that doesn&rsquo;t
mean there&rsquo;s ever going to be an understanding of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, as science
progresses, there will be attempts to draw political conclusions from
it&mdash;but they&rsquo;re going to be like this Piaget and the death
penalty thing: that is, people who have some political agenda will
find some total charlatan in the sciences who will tell them, &ldquo;this
is the basis for it.&rdquo; But in terms of actual scientific
knowledge, we aren&rsquo;t even within super-telescope distance of
touching any of these questions&mdash;there&rsquo;s just nothing
there. I mean, it&rsquo;s not that you can&rsquo;t do research on
them: you can do descriptive research, you can do therapy, you can
try to extend insights by making them a little bit more careful and
controlled&mdash;but that&rsquo;s about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s kind of
like psychotherapy: some people say they get something out of
psychotherapy, and maybe they do and maybe they don&rsquo;t&mdash;but
if they do, it&rsquo;s not because there&rsquo;s any science behind
it: there&rsquo;s no science behind it, any more than there is behind
faith-healing. It&rsquo;s just that somehow, various kinds of human
interactions sometimes seem to work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I remember an
anthropologist friend of mine who&rsquo;s worked in Southwest
American Indian communities once described to me people being healed
in tribal healing ceremonies: he said that if he didn&rsquo;t see it
with his own eyes, he wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it. So some person
will be really ill&mdash;I mean, very serious problems, physical
symptoms, he&rsquo;s not making it up&mdash;and they will go through
some community-type ritual which involves dancing, and singing, this
and that and the other thing, and the person just gets better: you
see it happening, nobody knows why it&rsquo;s happening; maybe it&rsquo;s
something about empathy, or being part of a community, whatever it
might be. Well, there&rsquo;s about as much scientific understanding
in that as there is in psychotherapy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or even just take
narrow questions of medicine. You know how they decide what kinds of
drugs are worth giving to you, say for heart problems? It&rsquo;s not
because the <i>science</i> of it is understood&mdash;they just do
epidemiological studies with controlled populations, to see if one of
the sample populations takes this drug and the other sample
population takes that drug, which one lives a little bit longer. I
mean, you can call that &ldquo;science&rdquo; if you like&mdash;but
it&rsquo;s the kind of science that can be done by anybody who can
count basically, or who knows something about studying samples and
things like that. It&rsquo;s not because anyone understands the
<i>biology</i> of these things&mdash;usually that&rsquo;s barely
understood, if at all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So I think that
whenever you hear people talking about things like &ldquo;learning of
compassion&rdquo; and so on, a big red flag should go up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: You don&rsquo;t
think science will ever have much to say about human behavior&mdash;there&rsquo;s
just something spiritual at the human level that is undefinable by
science?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s not just
about <i>humans</i> that scientific insight is very limited&mdash;even
simple physical things can&rsquo;t be dealt with either. For
instance, there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;three body problem&rdquo; in
physics: you can&rsquo;t really figure out what happens when three
bodies are moving, the equations are just too complicated. In fact, a
physicist I was talking to recently gave me another example&mdash;he
said if you take a cup of coffee with cream swirling around in it,
presumably all of the natural laws are known, but you can&rsquo;t
solve the equations because they&rsquo;re just too complex. Alright,
that&rsquo;s not human beings, that&rsquo;s cream swirling around in
a cup of coffee: we can&rsquo;t figure out what&rsquo;s going on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The point is, we may
know the laws, but the possibility of applying them, or of solving
the equations, or of working out the problems, or of understanding
what&rsquo;s going on, declines very fast when we get past only the
very simplest things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, we probably
<i>don&rsquo;t</i> know all the laws&mdash;I mean, it&rsquo;s very
unlikely that we really do know the laws, even at the core of
science. A physicist will tell you much more about this than I can,
but take, say, the matter in the universe: more than 90 percent of
the matter in the universe is what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;dark
matter&rdquo;&mdash;and it&rsquo;s called &ldquo;dark&rdquo; because
nobody knows what it is. It&rsquo;s just sort of postulated that it
exists, because if you don&rsquo;t postulate it, everything blows
up&mdash;so you have to assume that it&rsquo;s there. And that&rsquo;s
over 90 percent of the matter in the universe: you don&rsquo;t even
know what it is. In fact, a new branch of physics has developed
around superconductivity [&ldquo;superconductivity&rdquo; refers to
the complete disappearance of electrical resistance in various solids
at ultra-low temperatures], and while I don&rsquo;t have the
knowledge to evaluate the claims, what some of the physicists working
on it say is that they can now virtually prove (I mean, not <i>quite</i>
prove, but come quite close to proving) that in this domain of highly
condensed matter, there are principles which are literally not
deducible from the known laws of nature: so you can&rsquo;t reduce
the principles of superconductivity to the known laws of nature. And
again, that&rsquo;s talking about really simple things, nothing like
a complex organism.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Then when you begin
to talk about how organisms develop&mdash;well, people say it&rsquo;s
&ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s not false:
undoubtedly Darwin was sort of right. But it could be that natural
selection is only a very peripheral part of the development of
organisms. So, there&rsquo;s a channel of physical possibilities that
physical laws make available, and within that channel of physical
possibilities only certain things can happen&mdash;and within the
range of those things that can happen, you are going to get effects
due to natural selection. But the structure of the channel is totally
unknown: I mean, nobody knows what kinds of laws apply to complex
organisms, there are just the bare beginnings these days of the
studies of  self-organizing systems&mdash;how systems develop
structure and complexity just by virtue of their nature. These things
are just barely beginning to be understood&mdash;and we&rsquo;re
talking about things <i>way</i> simpler than human beings.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance, in
neurophysiology, the organism that people study is a little worm
called nematodes&mdash;and the reason they study nematodes is because
they&rsquo;re tiny, for one thing: they have a thousand cells, a
three-day gestation period, three hundred neurons, and the entire
wiring diagram of the three hundred neurons is known, so we know
exactly how they&rsquo;re all linked up together. But still, nobody
can figure out why the stupid worm does what it does, whatever it
does&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, probably turn left or something.
Whatever it does is so far unexplained on the basis of a
three-hundred-neuron system, where the entire structure of it is
known, and the whole gestation period is completely known. It&rsquo;s
just too complicated, too many things are going on, there are too
many chemical interactions. And this is three hundred neurons&mdash;it&rsquo;s
not 10<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">11</font></sup>
neurons, like in your head. So the difference is just so
qualitatively huge that the fall-off in understanding when it comes
to human beings is extremely dramatic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And this is again
why the study of language is so particularly interesting, because for
some reason it seems like things in the inorganic world: there are
aspects of it you can study by the methods of the sciences, which is
curious&mdash;but still it&rsquo;s like a little laser beam of light
that goes through human behavior, leaving most things about language
out. Like, science has nothing to say about what you and I are doing
now&mdash;only about the mechanisms that are <i>involved</i> in it,
not about how we do it. About that, there&rsquo;s nothing to say,
except again you can write poems. So the reach of scientific
understanding is highly specific: very deep in the few areas where it
goes, but they&rsquo;re limited areas.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, when you say
that human behavior might be beyond our inquiry, that&rsquo;s
possible&mdash;but I wouldn&rsquo;t say that&rsquo;s because of a
&ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; property we have: the same thing might be
true of large parts of nature. So there&rsquo;s some capacity of the
brain, some faculty of the mind that nobody understands, which allows
us to do scientific inquiry&mdash;and like any other part of biology,
it&rsquo;s highly structured: it&rsquo;s very good at certain things,
and consequently very bad at other things. I mean, you can&rsquo;t be
good at something if you&rsquo;re not bad at something else, those
two things necessarily go together&mdash;like, if you&rsquo;re a
great weight-lifter, you&rsquo;re going to be a rotten butterfly. You
can&rsquo;t be both, right? So if a human embryo can become a human
being, it can&rsquo;t become a fly&mdash;it&rsquo;s too &ldquo;weak&rdquo;
to become a fly, if you like, because it&rsquo;s &ldquo;strong&rdquo;
enough to become a human being: by a matter of logic, those things go
together. So if you have a great capacity in one area, you&rsquo;re
going to have lousy capacities in another area. And if the human
science-forming capacity is good enough to figure out quantum theory
for some completely unexplained reason, it&rsquo;s also going to be
so bad that it&rsquo;s not going to figure out lots of other things.
And we don&rsquo;t know what those  other things are&mdash;but they
might very well be most everything that we&rsquo;re really interested
in.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So when someone
comes along claiming a scientific basis for some social policy or
anything else having to do with human beings, I&rsquo;d be very
skeptical if I were you&mdash;because the knowledge just isn&rsquo;t
there right now, and may never be, either.</p>

Smith: Real and Fake<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You said
that classical liberalism was &ldquo;anti-capitalist.&rdquo; What did
you mean by that?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the
underlying, fundamental principles of Adam Smith and other classical
liberals were that people should be free: they shouldn&rsquo;t be
under the control of authoritarian institutions, they shouldn&rsquo;t
be subjected to things like division of labor, which destroys them.
So look at Smith: why was he in favor of markets? He gave kind of a
complicated argument for them, but at the core of it was the idea
that if you had perfect liberty, markets would lead to perfect
equality&mdash;that&rsquo;s why Adam Smith was in favor of markets.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">34</font></sup>
Adam Smith was in favor of markets because he thought that people
ought to be completely equal&mdash;<i>completely equal</i>&mdash;and
that was because, as a classical liberal, he believed that people&rsquo;s
fundamental character involves notions like sympathy, and solidarity,
the right to control their own work, and so on and so forth: all the
exact opposite of capitalism.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, there are
no two points of view more antithetical than classical liberalism and
capitalism&mdash;and that&rsquo;s why when the University of Chicago
publishes a bicentennial edition of Smith, they have to distort the
text (which they did): because as a true classical liberal, Smith was
strongly opposed to all of the idiocy they now spout in his name.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So if you read
George Stigler&rsquo;s introduction to the bicentennial edition of
<i>The Wealth of Nations</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s a big scholarly
edition, University of Chicago Press, so it&rsquo;s kind of
interesting to look at&mdash;it is diametrically opposed to Smith&rsquo;s
text on point after point.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">35</font></sup>
Smith is famous for what he wrote about division of labor: he&rsquo;s
supposed to have thought that division of labor was a great thing.
Well, he didn&rsquo;t: he thought division of labor was a <i>terrible</i>
thing&mdash;in fact, he said that in any civilized society, the
government is going to have to intervene to prevent division of labor
from simply destroying people. Okay, now take a look at the
University of Chicago&rsquo;s index (you know, a detailed scholarly
index) under &ldquo;division of labor&rdquo;: you won&rsquo;t find an
entry for that passage&mdash;it&rsquo;s simply not there.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">36</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
<i>real</i> scholarship: suppress the facts totally, present them as
the opposite of what they are, and figure, &ldquo;probably nobody&rsquo;s
going to read to page 473 anyhow, because I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; I
mean, ask the guys who edited it if  <i>they</i> ever read to page
473&mdash;answer: well, they probably read the first paragraph, then
sort of remembered what they&rsquo;d been taught in some college
course.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is,
for classical liberals in the eighteenth century, there was a certain
conception of just what human beings are like&mdash;namely, that what
kind of creatures they are depends on the kind of work they do, and
the kind of control they have over it, and their ability to act
creatively and according to their own decisions and choices. And
there was in fact a lot of very insightful comment about this at the
time.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for example, one
of the founders of classical liberalism, Wilhelm von Humboldt (who
incidentally is very admired by so-called &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo;
today, because they don&rsquo;t read him), pointed out that if a
worker produces a beautiful object on command, you may &ldquo;admire
what the worker does, but you will despise what he is&rdquo;&mdash;because
that&rsquo;s not really behaving like a human being, it&rsquo;s just
behaving like a machine. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">37</font></sup>
And that conception runs right through classical liberalism. In fact,
even half a century later, Alexis de Tocqueville [French politician
and writer] pointed out that you can have systems in which &ldquo;the
art advances and the artisan recedes,&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s
inhuman&mdash;because what you&rsquo;re really interested in is the
artisan, you&rsquo;re interested in <i>people</i>, and for people to
have the opportunity to live full and rewarding lives they have to be
in control of what they do, even if that happens to be economically
less efficient.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">38</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, okay&mdash;obviously
there&rsquo;s just been a dramatic change in intellectual and
cultural attitudes over the past couple centuries. But I think those
classical liberal conceptions now have to be recovered, and the ideas
at the heart of them should take root on a mass scale.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, the sources of
power and authority that people could see in front of their eyes in
the eighteenth century were quite different from the ones that we
have today&mdash;back then it was the feudal system, and the Church,
and the absolutist state that they were focused on; they couldn&rsquo;t
see the industrial corporation, because it didn&rsquo;t exist yet.
But if you take the basic classical liberal principles and apply them
to the modern period, I think you actually come pretty close to the
principles that animated revolutionary Barcelona in the late 1930s&mdash;to
what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;anarcho-syndicalism.&rdquo;
[Anarcho-syndicalism is a form of libertarian socialism that was
practiced briefly in regions of Spain during its revolution and civil
war of 1936, until it was destroyed by the simultaneous efforts of
the Soviet Union, the Western powers, and the Fascists.] I think
that&rsquo;s about as high a level as humans have yet achieved in
trying to realize these libertarian principles, which in my view are
the right ones. I mean, I&rsquo;m not saying that everything that was
done in that revolution was right, but in its general spirit and
character, in the idea of developing the kind of society that Orwell
saw and described in I think his greatest work, <i>Homage to
Catalonia</i>&mdash;with popular control over all the institutions of
society&mdash;okay, that&rsquo;s the right direction in which to
move, I think.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">39</font></sup></p>

Computer and the Crowbar<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, given
what you were saying before about our limited understanding of human
nature and social change, don&rsquo;t you think there&rsquo;s a
caution there in general for people intervening in social patterns
involving human beings?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yes&mdash;any kind
of drastic intervention in a human being, or a human society, is very
dubious. Like, suppose you&rsquo;ve got a personal computer and it
isn&rsquo;t working&mdash;it&rsquo;s a bad idea to hit it with a
crowbar. Maybe hitting it with a crowbar will by accident fix it, but
it&rsquo;s by and large not a good tactic&mdash;and human societies
are much more complex than computers, as are human beings. So you
really never understand what you&rsquo;re doing. People have to carry
out changes for themselves: they can&rsquo;t be imposed upon them
from above.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Take the Spanish
Revolution again. I mean, that was just one year in a rather
undeveloped country (though it had industry and so on), so it&rsquo;s
not like a model for the future. But a lot of interesting things
happened in the course of it, and they didn&rsquo;t just happen out
of the blue&mdash;they happened out of maybe fifty years of serious
organizing and experimentation, and attempts to try it, and failures,
and being smashed up by the army, and then trying again. So when
people say it was spontaneous, that&rsquo;s just not true: it came
from a lot of experience, and thinking, and working, and so on, and
then when the revolutionary moment came and the existing system sort
of collapsed, people had in their heads a picture of what to do, and
had even tried it, and they then tried to implement it on a mass
scale. And it was implemented in many different ways&mdash;there
wasn&rsquo;t any single pattern that was followed, the various
collectives were experimenting on their own under different
conditions, and finding out for themselves what worked.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">40</font></sup>
And that&rsquo;s a good example of how I think constructive change
has to happen.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
if an economist from, say, Harvard, goes to some Eastern European
country today and tells them, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the way to
develop,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s worse than hitting a computer with a
crowbar: there are a million different social and cultural and
economic factors they don&rsquo;t understand, and any big change
that&rsquo;s pressed on people is very likely to be disastrous, no
matter what it is&mdash;and of course, it always <i>is</i>
disastrous. Incidentally, it&rsquo;s disastrous for the <i>victims</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s
usually very good for the people who are carrying out the
experiments, which is why these experiments have been carried out for
the last couple hundred years, since the British started them in
India. I mean, every one of them is a disaster for the victims and
they&rsquo;re invariably good for the guys carrying out the
experiments.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">41</font></sup>
Well, as far as people who are interested in social reform are
concerned, what that suggests is, people better do it themselves, and
a step at a time, under their own control. That&rsquo;s in fact what
was being attempted on a fairly local scale in Barcelona, and I think
it&rsquo;s the kind of thing we have to work towards now.</p>

Leninist/Capitalist Intelligentsia<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Your vision
of a libertarian socialism is a very appealing one&mdash;I&rsquo;m
wondering, what&rsquo;s gone wrong?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First of all, maybe
nothing&rsquo;s gone wrong. You could argue that we haven&rsquo;t
been ready for it yet&mdash;but there was also a period when we
weren&rsquo;t ready for ending slavery either; when conditions,
including subjective conditions, were such that abolition just wasn&rsquo;t
in the cards. So one could argue that conditions today are such that
we need the degree of hierarchy and domination that exists in
totalitarian institutions like capitalist enterprises, just in order
to satisfy our needs&mdash;or else a &#65533;&#65533;dictatorship of
the proletariat,&rdquo; or some other authoritarian structure like
that. I mean, I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it&mdash;but the point
is, the justification for any kind of power system has to be <i>argued</i>
and proven to people before it has any claim to legitimacy. And those
arguments haven&rsquo;t been made out in this case.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you look at
what&rsquo;s actually <i>happened</i> to the various efforts at
libertarian socialism that have taken place around the world, the
concentration of force and violence present in those situations has
just been such that certain outcomes were virtually guaranteed, and
consequently all incipient efforts at cooperative workers&rsquo;
control, say, have simply been crushed. There have in fact been
efforts in this direction for hundreds of years&mdash;the problem is,
they regularly get destroyed. And often they&rsquo;re destroyed by
force.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The Bolsheviks
[political party that seized power during the Russian Revolution and
later became the Communist Party] are a perfect example. In the
stages leading up to the Bolshevik coup in October 1917, there <i>were</i>
incipient socialist institutions developing in Russia&mdash;workers&rsquo;
councils, collectives, things like that [i.e. after a popular
revolution first toppled the  Tsar in February 1917]. And they
survived to an extent once the Bolsheviks took over&mdash;but not for
very long; Lenin and Trotsky pretty much eliminated them as they
consolidated their power. I mean, you can argue about the
<i>justification</i> for eliminating them, but the fact is that the
socialist initiatives were pretty quickly eliminated.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, people who want
to justify it say, &ldquo;The Bolsheviks had to do it&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the standard justification: Lenin and Trotsky had to do it, because
of the contingencies of the civil war, for survival, there wouldn&rsquo;t
have been food otherwise, this and that. Well, obviously the question
there is, was that true? To answer that, you&rsquo;ve got to look at
the historical facts: I don&rsquo;t think it was true. In fact, I
think the incipient socialist structures in Russia were dismantled
<i>before</i> the really dire conditions arose. Alright, here you get
into a question where you don&rsquo;t want to be too cavalier about
it&mdash;it&rsquo;s a question of historical fact, and of what the
people were like, what they were thinking and so on, and you&rsquo;ve
got to find out what the answer is, you can&rsquo;t just guess. But
from reading their own writings, my feeling is that Lenin and Trotsky
knew what they were doing, it was conscious and understandable, and
they even had a theory behind it, both a moral theory and a
socio-economic theory.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">1</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First of all, as
orthodox Marxists, they didn&rsquo;t really believe that a socialist
revolution was <i>possible</i> in Russia, because Russia was just a
peasant backwater: it wasn&rsquo;t the kind of advanced industrial
society where in their view the coming socialist revolution was
supposed to happen. So when the Bolsheviks got power, they were
hoping to carry out kind of a holding action and wait for &ldquo;the
iron laws of history&rdquo; to grind out the revolution in Germany,
where it was supposed to happen by historical necessity, and then
Russia would continue to be a backwater, but it would then develop
with German help.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">2</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it didn&rsquo;t
end up happening in Germany: there <i>was</i> a revolution, in
January 1919, but it was wiped out, and the German working class was
suppressed. So at that point, Lenin and Trotsky were stuck holding
the bag&mdash;and they basically ended up trying to run a peasant
society by violence: since Russia was such a deeply impoverished
Third World society, they thought it was necessary just to beat the
people into development. So they took steps to turn the workers into
what they called a &ldquo;labor army,&rdquo; under control of a
&ldquo;maximal leader,&rdquo; who was going to force the country to
industrialize under what they themselves referred to as
&ldquo;state-capitalism.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">3</font></sup>
Their hope was that this would carry Russia over the early stages of
capitalism and industrialization, until it reached a point of
material development where then the iron laws of history would start
to work as the Master said they were going to, and socialism would
finally be achieved [i.e. Karl Marx theorized that history progresses
according to natural &ldquo;laws,&rdquo; and that the advanced stages
of capitalism will inevitably lead to socialism].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So there was a
theory behind their actions, and in fact a moral principle&mdash;namely,
it will be better for people in the long run if we do this. But  what
they did, I think, was to set the framework for a totalitarian
system, which of course Stalin then accelerated.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Would you
describe the authoritarian result of the Bolsheviks&rsquo; actions as
an honest mistake, a &ldquo;historical accident&rdquo; maybe&mdash;or
was it just the natural outgrowth of the Leninist worldview: the idea
that only a few people are smart and knowledgeable enough to be the
leaders, and they should run the show?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, in my opinion
the heart of the problem is Marxism-Leninism itself&mdash;the very
idea that a &ldquo;vanguard party&rdquo; can, or has any right to, or
has any capacity to lead the stupid masses towards some future
they&rsquo;re too dumb to understand for themselves. I think what
it&rsquo;s going to lead them towards is &ldquo;I rule you with a
whip.&rdquo; Institutions of domination have a nice way of
reproducing themselves&mdash;I think that&rsquo;s kind of like an
obvious sociological truism.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And actually, if you
look back, that was in fact Bakunin&rsquo;s prediction half a century
before&mdash;he said this was exactly what was going to happen.
[Bakunin was a nineteenth-century Russian anarchist, and with Marx a
leading figure in the main socialist labor organization of the time,
the First International.] I mean, Bakunin was talking about the
people around Marx, this was before Lenin was born, but his
prediction was that the nature of the intelligentsia as a formation
in modern industrial society is that they are going to try to become
the social managers. Now, they&rsquo;re not going to become the
social managers because they own capital, and they&rsquo;re not going
to become the social managers because they&rsquo;ve got a lot of
guns. They are going to become the social managers because they can
control, organize, and direct what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo;&mdash;they
have the skills to process information, and to mobilize support for
decision-making, and so on and so forth. And Bakunin predicted that
these people would fall into two categories. On the one hand, there
would be the &ldquo;left&rdquo; intellectuals, who would try to rise
to power on the backs of mass popular movements, and if they could
gain power, they would then beat the people into submission and try
to control them. On the other hand, if they found that they couldn&rsquo;t
get power that way themselves, they would become the servants of what
we would nowadays call &ldquo;state-capitalism,&rdquo; though Bakunin
didn&rsquo;t use the term. And either of these two categories of
intellectuals, he said, would be &ldquo;beating the people with the
people&rsquo;s stick&rdquo;&mdash;that is, they&rsquo;d be presenting
themselves as representatives of the people, so they&rsquo;d be
holding the people&rsquo;s stick, but they would be beating the
people with it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">4</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, Bakunin didn&rsquo;t
go on with this, but I think it follows from his analysis that it&rsquo;s
extremely easy to shift from one position to the other&mdash;it&rsquo;s
extremely easy to undergo what&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;God That
Failed&rdquo; syndrome. You start off as basically a Leninist,
someone who&rsquo;s going to become part of what Bakunin called the
&ldquo;Red Bureaucracy,&rdquo; you see that power doesn&rsquo;t lie
that way, and then you very easily become an ideologist of the right,
and devote  your life to exposing the sins of your former comrades,
who haven&rsquo;t yet seen the light and shifted to where power
really lies. And you barely have to change at all, really, you&rsquo;re
just operating under a different formal power structure. In fact,
we&rsquo;re seeing it right now in the former Soviet Union: the same
guys who were Communist thugs, Stalinist thugs two years back are now
running banks, they&rsquo;re enthusiastic free-marketeers, praising
America and so on. And this has been going on for forty years&mdash;it&rsquo;s
become kind of a joke.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, Bakunin didn&rsquo;t
say it&rsquo;s the <i>nature</i> of people that this will happen. I
mean, I don&rsquo;t know how much he thought it through, but what we
should say is that a Red Bureaucracy or its state-capitalist
commissar-class equivalent is not going to take over because that&rsquo;s
the nature of people&mdash;it&rsquo;s that the ones who <i>don&rsquo;t</i>
do it will be cast by the wayside, the ones who do do it will make
out. The ones who are ruthless and brutal and harsh enough to seize
power are the ones who are going to survive. The ones who try to
associate themselves with popular organizations and help the general
population <i>itself</i> become organized, who try to assist popular
movements in that kind of way, they&rsquo;re just not going to
survive under these situations of concentrated power.</p>

&ldquo;Theory&rdquo; and Intellectual Fakery<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam,
apart from the idea of the &ldquo;vanguard,&rdquo; I&rsquo;m
interested why you&rsquo;re so critical of the whole broader category
of Marxist analysis in general&mdash;like people in the universities
and so on who refer to themselves as general&mdash;like people in the
universities and so on who refer to themselves as &ldquo;Marxists.&rdquo;
I&rsquo;ve noticed you&rsquo;re never very happy with it.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I guess one
thing that&rsquo;s unattractive to me about &ldquo;Marxism&rdquo; is
the very idea that there <i>is</i> such a thing. It&rsquo;s a rather
striking fact that you don&rsquo;t find things like &ldquo;Marxism&rdquo;
in the sciences&mdash;like, there isn&rsquo;t any part of physics
which is &ldquo;Einsteinianism,&rdquo; let&rsquo;s say, or
&ldquo;Planckianism&rdquo; or something like that. It doesn&rsquo;t
make any sense&mdash;because people aren&rsquo;t gods: they just
discover things, and they make mistakes, and their graduate students
tell them why they&rsquo;re wrong, and then they go on and do things
better the next time. But there are no gods around. I mean,
scientists do use the terms &ldquo;Newtonianism&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Darwinism,&rdquo; but nobody thinks of those as doctrines that
you&rsquo;ve got to somehow be loyal to, and figure out what the
Master thought, and what he would have said in this new circumstance
and so on. That sort of thing is just completely alien to rational
existence, it only shows up in irrational domains.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So Marxism,
Freudianism: any one of these things I think is an irrational cult.
They&rsquo;re theology, so they&rsquo;re whatever you think of
theology; I don&rsquo;t think much of it. In fact, in my view that&rsquo;s
exactly the right analogy: notions like Marxism and Freudianism
belong to the history of organized religion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So part of my
problem is just its existence: it seems to me that even to <i>discuss</i>
 something like &ldquo;Marxism&rdquo; is already making a mistake.
Like, we don&rsquo;t discuss &ldquo;Planckism.&rdquo; Why not?
Because it would be crazy. Planck [German physicist] had some things
to say, and some of them are right, and those were absorbed into
later science, and some of them are wrong, and they were improved on.
It&rsquo;s not that Planck wasn&rsquo;t a great man&mdash;all kinds
of great discoveries, very smart, mistakes, this and that. That&rsquo;s
really the way we ought to look at it, I think. As soon as you set up
the idea of &ldquo;Marxism&rdquo; or &ldquo;Freudianism&rdquo; or
something, you&rsquo;ve already abandoned rationality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It seems to me the
question a rational person ought to ask is, what is there in Marx&rsquo;s
work that&rsquo;s worth saving and modifying, and what is there that
ought to be abandoned? Okay, then you look and you find things. I
think Marx did some very interesting descriptive work on
nineteenth-century history. He was a very good journalist. When he
describes the British in India, or the Paris Commune [70-day French
workers&rsquo; revolution in 1871], or the parts of <i>Capital</i>
that talk about industrial London, a lot of that is kind of
interesting&mdash;I think later scholarship has improved it and
changed it, but it&rsquo;s quite interesting.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">5</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">He had an abstract
model of capitalism which&mdash;I&rsquo;m not sure how valuable it
is, to tell you the truth. It was an abstract model, and like any
abstract model, it&rsquo;s not really intended to be descriptively
accurate in detail, it&rsquo;s intended to sort of pull out some
crucial features and study those. And you have to ask in the case of
an abstract model, how much of the complex reality does it really
capture? That&rsquo;s questionable in this case&mdash;first of all,
it&rsquo;s questionable how much of nineteenth-century capitalism it
captured, and I think it&rsquo;s even more questionable how much of
late-twentieth-century capitalism it captures.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are supposed
to be <i>laws</i> [i.e. of history and economics]. I can&rsquo;t
understand them, that&rsquo;s all I can say; it doesn&rsquo;t seem to
me that there are any laws that follow from it. Not that I know of
any <i>better</i> laws, I just don&rsquo;t think we know about &ldquo;laws&rdquo;
in history.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There&rsquo;s
nothing about socialism in Marx, he wasn&rsquo;t a socialist
philosopher&mdash;there are about five sentences in Marx&rsquo;s
whole work that refer to socialism. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">6</font></sup>
He was a theorist of capitalism. I think he introduced some
interesting concepts at least, which every sensible person ought to
have mastered and employ, notions like class, and relations of
production . . .</p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Dialectics is one
that I&rsquo;ve never understood, actually&mdash;I&rsquo;ve just
never understood what the word means. Marx doesn&rsquo;t use it,
incidentally, it&rsquo;s used by Engels.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">7</font></sup>
And if anybody can tell me what it is, I&rsquo;ll be happy. I mean,
I&rsquo;ve read all kinds of things which talk about &ldquo;dialectics&rdquo;&mdash;I
haven&rsquo;t the foggiest idea what it is. It seems to mean
something about complexity, or alternative positions, or change, or
something. I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I&rsquo;ll tell you
the honest truth: I&rsquo;m kind of simple-minded when it comes to
these things. Whenever I hear a four-syllable word I get skeptical,
because I want to make sure you can&rsquo;t say it in monosyllables.
Don&rsquo;t forget, part of the whole intellectual vocation is
creating a niche for yourself, and if everybody can understand what
you&rsquo;re talking about, you&rsquo;ve sort of lost, because then
what makes you special? What makes you special has got to be
something that you had to work really hard to understand, and you
mastered it, and all those guys out there don&rsquo;t understand it,
and then that becomes the basis for your privilege and your power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So take what&rsquo;s
called &ldquo;literary theory&rdquo;&mdash;I mean, I don&rsquo;t
think there&rsquo;s any such thing as literary &ldquo;theory,&rdquo;
any more than there&rsquo;s cultural &ldquo;theory&rdquo; or
historical &ldquo;theory.&rdquo; If you&rsquo;re just reading books
and talking about them and getting people to understand them, okay,
you can be terrific at that, like Edmund Wilson was terrific at
it&mdash;but he didn&rsquo;t have a literary <i>theory.</i> On the
other hand, if you want to mingle in the same room with that
physicist over there who&rsquo;s talking about quarks, you&rsquo;d
better have a complicated theory too that nobody can understand: <i>he</i>
has a complicated theory that nobody can understand, why shouldn&rsquo;t
<i>I</i> have a complicated theory that nobody can understand? If
someone came along with a theory of history, it would be the same:
either it would be truisms, or maybe some smart ideas, like somebody
could say, &ldquo;Why not look at economic factors lying behind the
Constitution?&rdquo; or something like that&mdash;but there&rsquo;d
be nothing there that couldn&rsquo;t be said in monosyllables.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, it&rsquo;s
extremely rare, outside of the natural sciences, to find things that
<i>can&rsquo;t</i> be said in monosyllables: there are just
interesting, simple ideas, which are often extremely difficult to
come up with and hard to work out. Like, if you want to try to
understand how the modern industrial economy developed, let&rsquo;s
say, that can take a lot of work. But the &ldquo;theory&rdquo; will
be extremely thin, if by &ldquo;theory&rdquo; we mean something with
principles which are not obvious when you first look at them, and
from which you can deduce surprising consequences and try to confirm
the principles&mdash;you&rsquo;re not going to find anything like
that in the social world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Incidentally, I
should say that my own political writing is often denounced from both
the left and the right for being non-theoretical&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
completely correct. But it&rsquo;s exactly as theoretical as anyone
else&rsquo;s, I just don&rsquo;t call it &ldquo;theoretical,&rdquo; I
call it &ldquo;trivial&rdquo;&mdash;which is in fact what it is. I
mean, it&rsquo;s not that some of these people whose stuff is
considered &ldquo;deep theory&rdquo; and so on don&rsquo;t have some
interesting things to say. Often they have very interesting things to
say. But it&rsquo;s nothing that you couldn&rsquo;t say at the level
of a high school student, or that a high school student couldn&rsquo;t
figure out if they had the time and support and a little bit of
training.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think people
should be extremely skeptical when intellectual life constructs
structures which aren&rsquo;t transparent&mdash;because the fact of
the matter is that in most areas of life, we just don&rsquo;t
understand anything very much. There are some areas, like say,
quantum physics, where they&rsquo;re not faking. But most of the time
it&rsquo;s just fakery, I think: anything that&rsquo;s at all
understood  can probably be described pretty simply. And when words
like &ldquo;dialectics&rdquo; come along, or &ldquo;hermeneutics,&rdquo;
and all this kind of stuff that&rsquo;s supposed to be very profound,
like Goering, &ldquo;I reach for my revolver.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I find it
very reinforcing that you don&rsquo;t understand the word
&ldquo;dialectics,&rdquo; it sort of validates me.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I&rsquo;m not saying
that it doesn&rsquo;t have any meaning&mdash;you observe people using
the term and they look like they&rsquo;re communicating. But it&rsquo;s
like when I watch people talking Turkish: something&rsquo;s going on,
but I&rsquo;m not part of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually,
occasionally in interviews I&rsquo;ve said this about not
understanding &ldquo;dialectics,&rdquo; and I get long letters back
from people saying, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand, here&rsquo;s
what &lsquo;dialectical&rsquo; is&rdquo;&mdash;and either it&rsquo;s
incomprehensible, or else it&rsquo;s trivial. So maybe I&rsquo;ve got
a gene missing or something&mdash;like people can be tone-deaf, they
just can&rsquo;t hear the music. But everything I encounter in these
fields either seems to be sort of interesting, but pretty obvious
once you see it&mdash;maybe you didn&rsquo;t see it at first, and
somebody had to point it out to you&mdash;or else just
incomprehensible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I&rsquo;m skeptical:
I think one has a right to be skeptical when you don&rsquo;t
understand something. I mean, when I look at a page of, say, quantum
electrodynamics, I don&rsquo;t understand a word of it. But I know
what I would have to do to <i>get</i> to understand it, and I&rsquo;m
pretty confident that I <i>could</i> get to understand it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
understood other complicated things. So I figure if I bothered to put
myself through the discipline, and I studied the early stuff and the
later stuff, I&rsquo;d finally get to the point where I understood
it. Or I could go to someone in the Physics Department and say, &ldquo;Tell
me why everybody&rsquo;s excited about this stuff,&rdquo; and they
could adapt it to my level and tell me how to pursue it further.
Maybe I wouldn&rsquo;t understand it very deeply, or I couldn&rsquo;t
have invented it or something, but I&rsquo;d at least begin to
understand it. On the other hand, when I look at a page of Marxist
philosophy or literary theory, I have the feeling that I could stare
at it for the rest of my life and I&rsquo;d never understand it&mdash;and
I don&rsquo;t know how to proceed to <i>get</i> to understand it any
better, I don&rsquo;t even know what steps I could take.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, it&rsquo;s
possible that these fields are beyond me, maybe I&rsquo;m not smart
enough or something. But that would have kind of a funny
conclusion&mdash;it&rsquo;s nothing to do with me. That would mean
that somehow in these domains people have been able to create
something that&rsquo;s more complex than physics and
mathematics&mdash;because those are subjects I think I could get to
understand. And I just don&rsquo;t believe that, frankly: I don&rsquo;t
believe that literary theorists or Marxian philosophers have advanced
to some new intellectual level that transcends century after century
of hard intellectual work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Do you think
the same thing about philosophy in general?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are parts of
philosophy which I think I understand, and it&rsquo;s most of
classical philosophy. And there are things that I don&rsquo;t
understand, because  they don&rsquo;t make any sense&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
okay too, these are hard questions. I mean, it&rsquo;s not
necessarily a criticism to say that something doesn&rsquo;t make
sense: there are subjects that it&rsquo;s hard to talk sensibly
about. But if I read, say, Russell, or analytic philosophy, or
Wittgenstein and so on, I think I can come to understand what they&rsquo;re
saying, and I can see why I think it&rsquo;s wrong, as I often do.
But when I read, you know, Derrida, or Lacan, or Althusser, or any of
these&mdash;I just don&rsquo;t understand it. It&rsquo;s like words
passing in front of my eyes: I can&rsquo;t follow the arguments, I
don&rsquo;t see the arguments, anything that looks like a description
of a fact looks wrong to me. So maybe I&rsquo;m missing a gene or
something, it&rsquo;s possible. But my honest opinion is, I think
it&rsquo;s all fraud.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I think you
may be glorifying the scientists a bit by projecting them as somehow
kind of pure. For example, take Newtonian mechanics: Einstein came
along and showed how it was wrong, but over the years the scientific
community did refer to it as &ldquo;Newtonian&rdquo; mechanics.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s an
interesting case, because Newtonian mechanics <i>was</i> treated as
kind of holy&mdash;because it was such a revolutionary development. I
mean, it was really the first time in human history that people ever
had an explanation of things in any deep sense: it was so
comprehensive, and so simple, and so far-reaching in its consequences
that it almost looked like it was <i>necessary.</i> And in fact, it
was treated that way for a long time&mdash;so much so that Kant, for
example, regarded it as the task of philosophy to derive Newtonian
physics from <i>a priori</i> principles, and to show that it was
certain truth, on a par with mathematics. And it really wasn&rsquo;t
until the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century that the
fallacy of those conceptions became quite clear, and with that
realization there was a real advance in our conception of what
&ldquo;science&rdquo; is. So science did have kind of a religious
character for a period, you&rsquo;re right&mdash;and that was
something we had to get ourselves out of, I think. It doesn&rsquo;t
happen anymore.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8678_2032848809"></a>Ideological
Control in the Sciences and Humanities<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Would you
say that as academic disciplines, the sciences are fundamentally
different from the humanities and social sciences in terms of
ideological control? There don&rsquo;t seem to be the same kinds of
barriers to inquiry or the same commitment to indoctrination in the
scientific fields as there are in other areas, like in economics or
political science, for instance.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I think there
<i>was</i> an ideological control problem in the sciences, it&rsquo;s
just that we transcended it&mdash;Galileo faced it, for example [the
Italian astronomer and scientist was arrested by the Roman Catholic
Church in 1633 and compelled to renounce his conclusion that the
earth revolves around the sun]. You go back a couple centuries in the
West and the ideological  control problem in the sciences was severe:
Descartes is alleged to have destroyed the final volume of his
treatise on the world, the one that was supposed to deal with the
human mind, because he learned of the fate of Galileo. That&rsquo;s
the analog to death squads&mdash;the Inquisition was doing precisely
that. Okay, that&rsquo;s passed in the West at least, but not
everywhere.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But why has
it passed?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I think there
are a few reasons. One is just a general increase in freedom and
enlightenment, won through popular struggles over centuries&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
become a much freer society than we were in absolutist times. And
intellectuals have often played a role in that, breaking down
ideological barriers and creating kind of a space for greater freedom
of thought, for instance during the Enlightenment [in the eighteenth
century]. That often took a lot of courage and quite a struggle, and
it goes on until today.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are also
utilitarian reasons. It turns out that, especially since the
mid-nineteenth century, the ability to gain a deeper understanding of
the physical world through modern science has interacted critically
with modern industrial development: progress in the sciences has
contributed materially to private profit-making, private power. So
there are utilitarian reasons for allowing freedom of scientific
inquiry, but I wouldn&rsquo;t over-exaggerate them&mdash;I think
what&rsquo;s happened with the sciences is a lot like the process
that&rsquo;s led to freedom in other domains, like why we don&rsquo;t
have slavery, let&rsquo;s say, or why after 150 years of American
history women won the right to vote [in 1920].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And also, remember,
after the great scientific revolutions that led to the Enlightenment,
it got to the point where you couldn&rsquo;t <i>do</i> science
anymore if you were subjected to the kinds of doctrinal controls that
remain quite effective in other fields. I mean, if you&rsquo;re a
physicist after Newton trying to spin off ideological fanaticism,
you&rsquo;re just out of the game&mdash;progress has been too much.
That&rsquo;s very different from the social sciences and the
humanities&mdash;you can tell falsehoods forever in those fields and
nothing will ever stop you, like you don&rsquo;t have Mother Nature
around keeping you honest. And the result is, there&rsquo;s a real
difference in the two cultures.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So when you go to
graduate school in the natural sciences, you&rsquo;re immediately
brought into critical inquiry&mdash;and in fact, what you&rsquo;re
learning is kind of a craft; you don&rsquo;t really <i>teach</i>
science, people sort of get the idea how to do it as apprentices,
hopefully by working with good people. But the goal is to learn how
to do creative work, and to challenge everything. That&rsquo;s very
different from the humanities and the social sciences, where what
you&rsquo;re supposed to do is absorb a body of knowledge, and then
pick yourself a little area in it and for the rest of your life work
on that. I mean, the way you become a highly respected scholar in the
humanities, say, is to pick some arcane area, like English novels
from 1720 to 1790, and get to know more of the <i>data</i> about that
than any other human being in history.  So you know who copied this
word from that, and so on. A lot of it is kind of mindless, but
that&rsquo;s the sort of thing you&rsquo;re supposed to know. And
there&rsquo;s really very little intellectual challenge: the only way
you could be wrong is if you got a comma out of place&mdash;and in
fact, that&rsquo;s considered the worst crime. I&rsquo;m kind of
caricaturing it a bit&mdash;but frankly I think it works this way.
And certainly the sciences are very different.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8680_2032848809"></a>The
Function of the Schools<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: But I
guess I don&rsquo;t quite see how this ideological control mechanism
actually works in the humanities and social sciences&mdash;I mean,
how exactly is it that the schools end up being an indoctrination
system? Can you describe the process in more detail?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the main point
I think is that the entire school curriculum, from kindergarten
through graduate school, will be tolerated only so long as it
continues to perform its institutional role. So take the
universities, which in many respects are not very different from the
media in the way they function&mdash;though they&rsquo;re a much more
complex system, so they&rsquo;re harder to study systematically.
Universities do not generate nearly enough funds to support
themselves from tuition money alone: they&rsquo;re parasitic
institutions that need to be supported from the outside, and that
means they&rsquo;re dependent on wealthy alumni, on corporations, and
on the government, which are groups with the same basic interests.
Well, as long as the universities <i>serve</i> those interests,
they&rsquo;ll be funded. If they ever <i>stop</i> serving those
interests, they&rsquo;ll start to get in trouble.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for example, in
the late 1960s it began to appear that the universities were <i>not</i>
adequately performing that service&mdash;students were asking
questions, they were thinking independently, they were rejecting a
lot of the Establishment value-system, challenging all sorts of
things&mdash;and the corporations began to react to that, they began
to react in a number of ways. For one thing, they began to develop
alternative programs, like I.B.M. began to set up kind of a
vocational training program to produce engineers on their own: if
M.I.T. wasn&rsquo;t going to do it for them the way they wanted,
they&rsquo;d do it themselves&mdash;and that would have meant they&rsquo;d
stop funding M.I.T. Well, of course things never really got out of
hand in the Sixties, so the moves in that direction were very
limited. But those are the kinds of pressures there are.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">8</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And in fact, you can
even see similar things right now. Take all this business about Allan
Bloom and that book everybody&rsquo;s been talking about, <i>The
Closing of the American Mind</i>.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">9</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s this huge best-seller, I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve
bothered looking at it&mdash;it&rsquo;s mind-bogglingly stupid. I
read it once in the supermarket while my . . . I hate to say it,
while my wife was shopping I stood there and read the damn thing; it
takes about fifteen minutes to read.
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You read two
thousand words a minute?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, &ldquo;read&rdquo;&mdash;you
know, sort of turn the pages to see if there&rsquo;s anything there
that isn&rsquo;t totally stupid. But what that book is basically
saying is that education ought to be set up like some sort of variant
of the Marine Corps, in which you just march the students through a
canon of &ldquo;great thoughts&rdquo; that are picked out for
everybody. So some group of people will say, &ldquo;Here are the
great thoughts, the great thoughts of Western civilization are in
this corpus; you guys sit there and learn them, read them and learn
them, and be able to repeat them.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the kind of
model Bloom is calling for.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, anybody who&rsquo;s
ever thought about education or been involved in it, or even gone to
school, knows that the effect of that is that students will end up
knowing and understanding virtually nothing. It doesn&rsquo;t matter
how great the thoughts are, if they are simply imposed upon you from
the outside and you&rsquo;re forced through them step by step, after
you&rsquo;re done you&rsquo;ll have forgotten what they are. I mean,
I&rsquo;m sure that every one of you has taken any number of courses
in school in which you worked, and you did your homework, you passed
the exam, maybe you even got an &ldquo;A&rdquo;&mdash;and a week
later you couldn&rsquo;t even remember what the course was about. You
only learn things and learn how to think if there&rsquo;s some
purpose for learning, some motivation that&rsquo;s coming out of <i>you</i>
somehow. In fact, all of the methodology in education isn&rsquo;t
really much more than that&mdash;getting students to want to learn.
Once they want to learn, they&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is
that this model Bloom and all these other people are calling for is
just a part of the whole method of imposing discipline through the
schools, and of preventing people from learning how to think for
themselves. So what you do is make students go through and sort of
memorize a canon of what are called &ldquo;Good Books,&rdquo; which
you force on them, and then somehow great things are supposed to
happen. It&rsquo;s a completely stupid form of education, but I think
that&rsquo;s part of why it&rsquo;s selected and supported, and why
there&rsquo;s so much hysteria that it&rsquo;s been questioned in
past years&mdash;just because it&rsquo;s very functional to train
people and discipline them in ways like this. The popularity of the
Bloom thing, I would imagine, is mostly a reaction to the sort of
liberating effect that the student movement of the Sixties and other
challenges to the schools and universities began to have.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: All of
Allan Bloom&rsquo;s &ldquo;great thoughts&rdquo; are by elite white
males.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, okay&mdash;but
it wouldn&rsquo;t even matter if he had some different array of
material, it really wouldn&rsquo;t matter. The idea that there&rsquo;s
some array of &ldquo;the deep thoughts,&rdquo; and we smart people
will pick them out and you dumb guys will learn them&mdash;or
memorize them at least, because you don&rsquo;t really learn them if
they&rsquo;re just forced on you&mdash;that&rsquo;s nonsense. If
you&rsquo;re serious about, say, reading Plato,<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">10</font></sup>
it&rsquo;s fine to read Plato&mdash;but you try to figure  out what&rsquo;s
right, what&rsquo;s wrong, what&rsquo;s a better way of looking at
it, why was he saying this when he should have been saying something
else, what grotesque error of reasoning did he make over here, and so
on and so forth. That&rsquo;s the way you would read serious work,
just like you would in the sciences. But you&rsquo;re not supposed to
read it that way here, you&rsquo;re supposed to read it because it&rsquo;s
the truth, or it&rsquo;s the great thoughts or something. And that&rsquo;s
kind of like the worst form of theology.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The point is, it
doesn&rsquo;t matter <i>what</i> you read, what matters is <i>how</i>
you read it. Now, I don&rsquo;t mean comic books, but there&rsquo;s a
lot of cultural wealth out there from all over the place, and to
learn what it means for something to be culturally rich, you can
explore almost anywhere: there&rsquo;s no fixed subset that is the
basis of truth and understanding. I mean, you can read the &ldquo;Good
Books,&rdquo; and memorize what they said, and forget them a week
later&mdash;if it doesn&rsquo;t <i>mean</i> anything to you
personally, you&rsquo;d might as well not have read them. And it&rsquo;s
very hard to know what&rsquo;s <i>going</i> to mean something to
different people. But there&rsquo;s plenty of exciting literature
around in the world, and there&rsquo;s absolutely no reason to
believe that unless you&rsquo;ve read the Greeks and Dante and so on,
you&rsquo;ve missed things&mdash;I mean, yeah, you&rsquo;ve missed
things, but you&rsquo;ve also missed things if you haven&rsquo;t
learned something about other cultural traditions too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Just take a look at
philosophy, for example, which is a field that I know something
about: some of the best, most exciting, most active philosophers in
the contemporary world, people who&rsquo;ve made a real impact on the
field, couldn&rsquo;t tell Plato from Aristotle, except for what they
remember from some Freshman course they once took. Now, that&rsquo;s
not to say you shouldn&rsquo;t read Plato and Aristotle&mdash;sure,
there are millions of things you should read; nobody&rsquo;s ever
going to read more than a tiny fraction of the things you wished you
knew. But just reading them does you no good: you only learn if the
material is integrated into your own creative processes somehow,
otherwise it just passes through your mind and disappears. And
there&rsquo;s nothing valuable about that&mdash;it has basically the
effect of learning the catechism, or memorizing the Constitution or
something like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Real education is
about getting people involved in thinking for themselves&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s a tricky business to know how to do well, but clearly it
requires that whatever it is you&rsquo;re looking at has to somehow
catch people&rsquo;s interest and make them <i>want</i> to think, and
make them <i>want</i> to pursue and explore. And just regurgitating
&ldquo;Good Books&rdquo; is absolutely the worst way to do it&mdash;that&rsquo;s
just a way of turning people into automata. You may call that an
education if you want, but it&rsquo;s really the opposite of an
education, which is why people like William Bennett [Reagan&rsquo;s
Secretary of Education] and Allan Bloom and these others are all so
much in favor of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Are you
saying that the real purpose of the universities and the schools is
just to indoctrinate people&mdash;and really not much else?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I&rsquo;m not
quite saying that. Like, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that <i>no</i>
meaningful work takes place in the schools, or that they only exist
to provide manpower for the corporate system or something like
that&mdash;these are very complex systems, after all. But the basic
institutional role and function of the schools, and why they&rsquo;re
supported, is to provide an ideological service: there&rsquo;s a real
selection for obedience and conformity. And I think that process
starts in kindergarten, actually.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Let me just tell you
a personal story. My oldest, closest friend is a guy who came to the
United States from Latvia when he was fifteen, fleeing from Hitler.
He escaped to New York with his parents and went to George Washington
High School, which in those days at least was the school for bright
Jewish kids in New York City. And he once told me that the first
thing that struck him about American schools was the fact that if he
got a &ldquo;C&rdquo; in a course, nobody cared, but if he came to
school three minutes late he was sent to the principal&rsquo;s
office&mdash;and that generalized. He realized that what it meant is,
what&rsquo;s valued here is the ability to work on an assembly line,
even if it&rsquo;s an intellectual assembly line. The important thing
is to be able to obey orders, and to do what you&rsquo;re told, and
to be where you&rsquo;re supposed to be. The values are, you&rsquo;re
going to be a factory worker somewhere&mdash;maybe they&rsquo;ll call
it a university&mdash;but you&rsquo;re going to be following somebody
else&rsquo;s orders, and just doing your work in some prescribed way.
And what matters is discipline, not figuring things out for yourself,
or understanding things that interest you&mdash;those are kind of
marginal: just make sure you meet the requirements of a factory.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
pretty much what the schools are like, I think: they reward
discipline and obedience, and they punish independence of mind. If
you happen to be a little innovative, or maybe you forgot to come to
school one day because you were reading a book or something, that&rsquo;s
a tragedy, that&rsquo;s a crime&mdash;because you&rsquo;re not
supposed to think, you&rsquo;re supposed to obey, and just proceed
through the material in whatever way they require.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And in fact, most of
the people who make it through the education system and get into the
elite universities are able to do it because they&rsquo;ve been
willing to obey a lot of stupid orders for years and years&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the way I did it, for example. Like, you&rsquo;re told by some stupid
teacher, &ldquo;Do this,&rdquo; which you know makes no sense
whatsoever, but you do it, and if you do it you get to the next rung,
and then you obey the next order, and finally you work your way
through and they give you your letters: an awful lot of education is
like that, from the very beginning. Some people go along with it
because they figure, &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;ll do any stupid thing that
asshole says because I want to get ahead&rdquo;; others do it because
they&rsquo;ve just internalized the values&mdash;but after a while,
those two things tend to get sort of blurred. But you do it, or else
you&rsquo;re out: you ask too many questions and you&rsquo;re going
to get in trouble.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, there are also
people who <i>don&rsquo;t</i> go along&mdash;and they&rsquo;re called
&ldquo;behavior problems,&rdquo; or &ldquo;unmotivated,&rdquo; or
things like that. Well, you don&rsquo;t  want to be too glib about
it&mdash;there <i>are</i> children with behavior problems&mdash;but a
lot of them are just independent-minded, or don&rsquo;t like to
conform, or just want to go their own way. And they get into trouble
right from the very beginning, and are typically weeded out. I mean,
I&rsquo;ve taught young kids too, and the fact is there are always
some who just don&rsquo;t take your word for it. And the very
unfortunate tendency is to try to beat them down, because they&rsquo;re
a pain in the neck. But what they ought to be is encouraged. Yeah:
why take my word for it? Who the heck am I? Figure it out for
yourself. That&rsquo;s what real education would be <i>about,</i> in
fact.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, I happen
to have been very lucky myself and gone to an
experimental-progressive Deweyite school, from about the time I was
age one-and-a-half to twelve [John Dewey was an American philosopher
and educational reformer]. And there it was done routinely: children
were encouraged to challenge everything, and you sort of worked on
your own, you were supposed to think things through for yourself&mdash;it
was a real experience. And it was quite a striking change when it
ended and I had to go to the city high school, which was the pride of
the city school system. It was the school for academically-oriented
kids in Philadelphia&mdash;and it was the dumbest, most ridiculous
place I&rsquo;ve ever been, it was like falling into a black hole or
something. For one thing, it was extremely competitive&mdash;because
that&rsquo;s one of the best ways of controlling people. So everybody
was ranked, and you always knew exactly where you were: are you third
in the class, or maybe did you move down to fourth? All of this stuff
is put into people&rsquo;s heads in various ways in the schools&mdash;that
you&rsquo;ve got to beat down the person next to you, and just look
out for yourself. And there are all sorts of other things like that
too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is,
there&rsquo;s nothing <i>necessary</i> about them in education. I
know, because I went through an alternative to it&mdash;so it can
certainly be done. But given the external power structure of the
society in which they function now, the institutional role of the
schools for the most part is just to train people for obedience and
conformity, and to make them controllable and indoctrinated&mdash;and
as long as the schools fulfill that role, they&rsquo;ll be supported.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, of course, it
doesn&rsquo;t work a hundred percent&mdash;so you do get some people
all the way through who don&rsquo;t go along. And as I was saying, in
the sciences at least, people have to be trained for creativity and
disobedience&mdash;because there is no other way you can <i>do</i>
science. But in the humanities and social sciences, and in fields
like journalism and economics and so on, that&rsquo;s much less
true&mdash;there people have to be trained to be managers, and
controllers, and to accept things, and not to question too much. So
you really do get a very different kind of education. And people who
break out of line are weeded out or beaten back in all kinds of ways.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, it&rsquo;s
not very abstract: if you&rsquo;re, say, a young person in college,
or in journalism, or for that matter a fourth grader, and you have
too much of an independent mind, there&rsquo;s a whole variety of
devices that will be used to  deflect you from that error&mdash;and
if you can&rsquo;t be controlled, to marginalize or just eliminate
you. In fourth grade, you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;behavior problem.&rdquo;
In college, you may be &ldquo;irresponsible,&rdquo; or &ldquo;erratic,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;not the right kind of student.&rdquo; If you make it to the
faculty, you&rsquo;ll fail in what&rsquo;s sometimes called
&ldquo;collegiality,&rdquo; getting along with your colleagues. If
you&rsquo;re a young journalist and you&rsquo;re pursuing stories
that the people at the managerial level above you understand, either
intuitively or explicitly, are not to be pursued, you can be sent off
to work at the Police desk, and advised that you don&rsquo;t have
&ldquo;proper standards of objectivity.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a whole
range of these techniques.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, we live in a
free society, so you don&rsquo;t get sent to gas chambers and they
don&rsquo;t send the death squads after you&mdash;as is commonly
done, and not far from here, say in Mexico.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">11</font></sup>
But there are nevertheless quite successful devices, both subtle and
extreme, to ensure that doctrinal correctness is not seriously
infringed upon.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8682_2032848809"></a>Subtler
Methods of Control<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Let me just start
with some of the more subtle ways; I&rsquo;ll give you an example.
After I finished college, I went to this program at Harvard called
the &ldquo;Society of Fellows&rdquo;&mdash;which is kind of this
elite finishing school, where they teach you to be a Harvard or Yale
professor, and to drink the right wine, and say the right things, and
so on and so forth. I mean, you had all of the resources of Harvard
available to you and your only responsibility was to show up at a
dinner once a week, so it was great for just doing your work if you
wanted to. But the real point of the whole thing was socialization:
teaching the right values.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance, I
remember there was a lot of anglophilia at Harvard at the time&mdash;you
were supposed to wear British clothes, and pretend you spoke with a
British accent, that sort of stuff. In fact, there were actually guys
there who I thought were British, who had never been outside of the
United States. If any of you have studied literature or history or
something, you might recognize some of this, those are the places you
usually find it. Well, somehow I managed to survive that, I don&rsquo;t
know how exactly&mdash;but most didn&rsquo;t. And what I discovered
is that a large part of education at the really elite institutions is
simply refinement, teaching the social graces: what kind of clothes
you should wear, how to drink port the right way, how to have polite
conversation without talking about serious topics, but of course
indicating that you <i>could</i> talk about serious topics if you
were so vulgar as to actually do it, all kinds of things which an
intellectual is supposed to know how to do. And that was really the
main point of the program, I think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, there are
much more important cases too&mdash;and they&rsquo;re even more
revealing about the role of the elite schools. For example, the 1930s
were a period of major labor strife and labor struggle in the U.S.,
and it was  scaring the daylights out of the whole business community
here&mdash;because labor was finally winning the right to organize,
and there were other legislative victories as well. And there were a
lot of efforts to try to overcome this, but one of them was that
Harvard introduced a &ldquo;Trade Union Program.&rdquo; What it did
was to bring in rising young people in the labor movement&mdash;you
know, the guy who looks like he&rsquo;s going to be the Local
president next year&mdash;and have them stay in dorms in the Business
School, and put them through a whole socialization process, help them
come to share some of the values and understandings of the elite,
teach them that &ldquo;Our job is to work together,&rdquo; &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
all in this together,&rdquo; and so on and so forth. I mean, there
are always two lines: for the public it&rsquo;s, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
all in this together, management and labor are cooperating, joint
enterprise, harmony&rdquo; and so on&mdash;meanwhile business is
fighting a vicious class war on the side. And that effort to
socialize and integrate union activists&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ve never
measured its success, but I&rsquo;m sure it was very successful. And
the process was similar to what I experienced and saw a Harvard
education to be myself.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or let me tell you
another story I heard about twenty years ago from a black civil
rights activist who came up to study at Harvard Law School&mdash;it
kind of illustrates some of the other pressures that are around. This
guy gave a talk in which he described how the kids starting off at
Harvard Law School come in with long hair and backpacks and social
ideals, they&rsquo;re all going to go into public service law to
change the world and so on&mdash;that&rsquo;s the first year. Around
springtime, the recruiters come for the cushy summer jobs in the Wall
Street law firms, and these students figure, &ldquo;What the heck, I
can put on a tie and a jacket and shave for one day, just because I
need that money and why shouldn&rsquo;t I have it?&rdquo; So they put
on the tie and the jacket for that one day, and they get the job, and
then they go off for the summer&mdash;and when they come back in the
fall, it&rsquo;s ties, and jackets, and obedience, a shift of
ideology. Sometimes it takes two years.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, obviously he
was over-drawing the point&mdash;but those sorts of factors also are
very influential. I mean, I&rsquo;ve felt it all my life: it&rsquo;s
extremely easy to be sucked into the dominant culture, it can be very
appealing. There are a lot of rewards. And what&rsquo;s more, the
people you meet don&rsquo;t look like bad people&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
want to sit there and insult them. Maybe they&rsquo;re perfectly nice
people. So you try to be friends, maybe you even are friends. Well,
you begin to conform, you begin to adapt, you begin to smooth off the
harsher edges&mdash;and pretty soon it&rsquo;s just happened, it kind
of seeps in. And education at a place like Harvard is largely geared
to that, to a remarkable extent in fact.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And there are many
other subtle mechanisms which contribute to ideological control as
well, of course&mdash;including just the fact that the universities
support and encourage people to occupy themselves with irrelevant and
innocuous work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or just take the
fact that certain topics are unstudiable in the schools&mdash;
because they don&rsquo;t fall anywhere: the disciplines are divided
in such a way that they simply will not be studied. That&rsquo;s
something that&rsquo;s extremely important. So for example, take a
question that people were very worried about in the United States for
years and years&mdash;the economic competitiveness of Japan. Now, I
always thought the talk about &ldquo;American declinism&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Japan as Number 1&rdquo; was vastly overblown, just as the
later idea of a &ldquo;Japanese decline&rdquo; is wildly exaggerated.
In fact, Japan retains a very considerable edge in crucial areas of
manufacturing, especially in high tech. They did get in trouble
because of a huge stock market and real estate boom that collapsed,
but serious economists don&rsquo;t believe that Japan has really lost
competitiveness in these areas.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">12</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, why has Japan
been so economically competitive? I mean, there are a lot of reasons
why, but the major reason is very clear. Both Japan and the United
States (and every other industrial country in the world, actually)
have essentially state-coordinated economies&mdash;but our
traditional system of state coordination is less efficient than
theirs.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember, talk about
&ldquo;free trade&rdquo; is fine in editorials, but nobody actually
practices it in reality: in every modern economy, the taxpayers are
made to subsidize the private corporations, who then keep the profits
for themselves. But the point is, different countries have different
ways of arranging those subsidies. So take a look at the competitive
parts of the U.S. economy, the parts that are successful in
international trade&mdash;they&rsquo;re all state-subsidized.
Capital-intensive agriculture is a well-known case: American
capital-intensive agriculture is able to compete internationally
because the state purchases the excess products and stores them, and
subsidizes the energy inputs, and so on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or look at
high-technology industry: research and development for high
technology is very costly, and corporations don&rsquo;t make any
profits off it directly&mdash;so therefore the taxpayer is made to
pay for it. And in the United States, that&rsquo;s traditionally been
done largely through the Pentagon system: the Pentagon pays for
high-tech research and development, then if something comes out of it
which happens to be marketable, it&rsquo;s handed over to private
corporations so they can make the profits. And the research mostly
isn&rsquo;t weapons, incidentally&mdash;it&rsquo;s things like
computers, which are the center of any contemporary industrial
economy, and were developed through the Pentagon system in the United
States. And the same is true of virtually all high tech, in fact. And
furthermore, there&rsquo;s another important subsidy there: the
Pentagon also purchases the <i>output</i> of high-technology
industry, it serves as a state-guaranteed market for
waste-production&mdash;that&rsquo;s what contracts for developing
weapons systems are; I mean, you don&rsquo;t actually <i>use</i> the
weapons you&rsquo;re paying for, you just destroy them in a couple
years and replace them with the next array of even more advanced
stuff you don&rsquo;t need. Well, all of that is just perfect for
pouring continuous taxpayer subsidies into high-tech industry, and
it&rsquo;s because of these enormous subsidies that American high
tech is competitive internationally.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, Japan has run
its economy pretty much the same way we do, except with one crucial
difference. Instead of using the military system, the way they&rsquo;ve
worked their public subsidies in Japan is they have a government
ministry, M.I.T.I. [the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry], which sits down with the big corporations and
conglomerates and banking firms, and plans their economic system for
the next couple years&mdash;they plan how much consumption there&rsquo;s
going to be, and how much investment there&rsquo;s going to be, and
where the investment should go, and so on. Well, that&rsquo;s more
efficient. And since Japan is a very disciplined and obedient society
culturally, the population there just does what they tell them, and
nobody ever asks any questions about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, to see how
this difference played out over the years, just look at the &ldquo;Star
Wars&rdquo; program in the United States, for example. Star Wars [the
Strategic Defense Initiative] is the pretext for a huge amount of
research and development spending through the Pentagon system
here&mdash;it&rsquo;s our way of funding the new generation of
computer technology, lasers, new software, and so on. Well, if you
look at the distribution of expenses for Star Wars, it turns out that
it was virtually the same allocation of funding as was made through
the Japanese state-directed economic system in the same time period:
in those same years, M.I.T.I. made about the same judgments about how
to distribute their resources as we did, they spent about the same
proportion of money in lasers, and the same proportion in software,
and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">13</font></sup>
And the reason is that all of these planners make approximately the
same judgments about the likely new technologies.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, why was Japan
so competitive with the U.S. economically, despite highly
inauspicious conditions? There are a lot of reasons. But the main
reason is that they directed their public subsidy straight to the
commercial market. So to work on lasers, they tried to figure out
ways of producing lasers for the commercial market, and they do it
pretty well. But when we want to develop lasers for the commercial
market, what we do is pour the money into the Pentagon, which then
tries to work out a way to use a laser to shoot down a missile ten
thousand miles away&mdash;and if they can work that out, then they
hope there&rsquo;ll be some commercial spin-offs that come out of it
all. Okay, that&rsquo;s less efficient. And since the Japanese are no
dumber than we are, and they have an efficient system of
state-coordination while we have an inefficient one, over the years
they succeeded in the economic competition.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, these are
major phenomena of modern life&mdash;but where do you go to study
them in the universities or the academic profession? That&rsquo;s a
very interesting question. You don&rsquo;t go to the economics
department, because that&rsquo;s not what they look at: the real
hot-shot economics departments are interested in abstract models of
how a pure free-enterprise economy works&mdash;you know,
generalizations to ten-dimensional space of some nonexistent
free-market system. You don&rsquo;t go to the political science
department, because they&rsquo;re concerned with electoral
statistics, and voting patterns, and  micro-bureaucracy&mdash;like
the way one government bureaucrat talks to another in some detailed
air. You don&rsquo;t go to the anthropology department, because
they&rsquo;re studying hill tribesmen in New Guinea. You don&rsquo;t
go to the sociology department, because they&rsquo;re studying crime
in the ghettos. In fact, you don&rsquo;t go anywhere&mdash;there
isn&rsquo;t any field that deals with these topics. There&rsquo;s no
journal that deals with them. In fact, there is no academic
profession that is concerned with the central problems of modern
society. Now, you can go to the <i>business school</i>, and there
they&rsquo;ll talk about them&mdash;because those people are in the
real world. But not in the academic departments: nobody there is
going to tell you what&rsquo;s really going on in the world.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">14</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And it&rsquo;s
extremely important that there <i>not</i> be a field that studies
these questions&mdash;because if there ever were such a field, people
might come to understand too much, and in a relatively free society
like ours, they might start to do something with that understanding.
Well, no institution is going to encourage <i>that.</i> I mean,
there&rsquo;s nothing in what I just said that you couldn&rsquo;t
explain to junior high school students, it&rsquo;s all pretty
straightforward. But it&rsquo;s not what you study in a junior high
Civics course&mdash;what you study there is propaganda about the way
systems are supposed to work but don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Incidentally, part
of the genius of this aspect of the higher education system is that
it can get people to sell out even while they think they&rsquo;re
doing exactly the right thing. So some young person going into
academia will say to themself, &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m going to be a
real radical here&#65533;&#65533;&mdash;and you <i>can</i> be, as
long as you adapt yourself to these categories which guarantee that
you&rsquo;ll never ask the right questions, and that you&rsquo;ll
never even <i>look</i> at the right questions. But you don&rsquo;t
<i>feel</i> like you&rsquo;re selling out, you&rsquo;re not saying
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m working for the ruling class&rdquo; or anything like
that&mdash;you&rsquo;re not, you&rsquo;re being a Marxist economist
or something. But the effect is, they&rsquo;ve totally neutralized
you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, all of
these are subtle forms of control, with the effect of preventing
serious insight into the way that power actually works in the
society. And it makes very good sense for a system to be set up like
that: powerful institutions don&rsquo;t want to be investigated,
obviously. Why would they? They don&rsquo;t want the public to know
how they work&mdash;maybe the people inside them understand how they
work, but they don&rsquo;t want anybody else to know, because that
would threaten and undermine their power. So one should <i>expect</i>
the institutions to function in such a way as to protect
themselves&mdash;and some of the ways in which they protect
themselves are by various subtle techniques of ideological control
like these.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8684_2032848809"></a>Cruder
Methods of Control<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Then aside from all
that, there are also crude methods of control. So if some young
political scientist or economist decides they <i>are</i> going to try
to  ask these kinds of questions, the chances are they&rsquo;re going
to be marginalized in some fashion, or else be weeded out of the
institution altogether. At the extreme end, there have been repeated
university purges in the United States. During the 1950s, for
example, the universities were just cleaned out of dissident
thought&mdash;people were fired on all kinds of grounds, or not
allowed to teach things. And the effects of that were very strong.
Then during the late 1960s, when the political ferment really got
going, the purges began again&mdash;and often they were just straight
political firings, not even obscured. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">15</font></sup>
For instance, a lot of the best Asia scholars from the United States
are now teaching in Australia and Japan&mdash;because they couldn&rsquo;t
keep jobs in the U.S., they had the wrong ideas. Australia has some
of the best Southeast Asia scholars in the world, and they&rsquo;re
mostly Americans who were young scholars in the Sixties and couldn&rsquo;t
make it into the American academic system, because they thought the
wrong things. So if you want to study Cambodia with a top American
scholar, you basically have to go to Australia.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">16</font></sup>
One of the best Japan historians in the world [Herbert Bix] is
teaching in a Japanese university&mdash;he&rsquo;s American, but he
can&rsquo;t get a job in the United States.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or let me just tell
you a story about M.I.T., which is pretty revealing. A young
political science professor&mdash;who&rsquo;s by now one of the top
people in the field, incidentally [Thomas Ferguson]&mdash;was
appointed at M.I.T. as an assistant professor right after he got his
Ph.D. from Princeton; he&rsquo;s very radical, but he&rsquo;s also
extremely smart, so the department just needed him. Well, one day I
was sitting in my office and he came over fuming. He told me that the
chairman of his department had just come into his office and told him
straight out: &ldquo;If you ever want to get tenure in this
department, keep away from anything after the New Deal; you can write
all of your radical stuff up to the New Deal, but if you try and do
it for the post-New Deal period, you&rsquo;re never going to get
tenure in this department.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">17</font></sup>
He just told him straight out. Usually you&rsquo;re not told it
straight out, but you get to understand it&mdash;you get to
understand it from the reactions you receive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This kind of stuff
also happens with graduate students. I&rsquo;m what&rsquo;s called an
&ldquo;Institute Professor&rdquo; at M.I.T., which means I can teach
courses in any department of the university. And over the years I&rsquo;ve
taught all over the place&mdash;but if I even get <i>near</i>
Political Science, you can feel the bad vibes starting. So in other
departments, I&rsquo;m often asked to be on students&rsquo; Ph.D.
committees, but in Political Science it&rsquo;s virtually never
happened&mdash;and the few times it has happened, it&rsquo;s always
been Third World women. And there&rsquo;s a reason for that: Third
World women have a little bit of extra space to maneuver in, because
the department doesn&rsquo;t want to appear <i>too</i> overtly racist
or <i>too</i> overtly sexist, so there are some things they can do
that other people can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, a few years
ago, one very smart woman graduate student in the Political Science
Department wanted to do her dissertation on the media and Southern
Africa, and she wanted me to be on her Ph.D. committee. Okay,  it&rsquo;s
a topic that I&rsquo;m interested in, and I&rsquo;ve worked on it
probably more than anybody else there, so there was just no way for
them to say I couldn&rsquo;t do it. Then the routine started. The
first stage in the doctoral process is that the candidate has a
meeting with a couple of faculty members and presents her proposal.
Usually two faculty members show up, that&rsquo;s about it. This time
it was different: they circulated a notice through the department
saying that every faculty member had to show up&mdash;and the reason
was, <i>I</i> was going to be there, and they had to combat this
baleful influence. So everybody showed up.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the woman
started presenting her dissertation proposal, and you could just see
people turning pale. Somebody asked her, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your
hypothesis?&rdquo; &mdash;you&rsquo;re supposed to have a
hypothesis&mdash;and it was that media coverage of Southern Africa is
going to be influenced by corporate interests. People were
practically passing out and falling out the windows. Then starts the
critical analysis: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your methodology going to be?
What tests are you going to use?&rdquo; And gradually an apparatus
was set up and a level of proof demanded that you just can&rsquo;t
meet in the social sciences. It wasn&rsquo;t, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to read the editorials and figure out what they say&rdquo;&mdash;you
had to count the words, and do all sorts of statistical nonsense, and
so on and so forth. But she fought it through, she just continued
fighting. They ultimately required so much junk in her thesis, so
much irrelevant, phony social-scientific junk, numbers and charts and
meaningless business, that you could barely pick out the content from
the morass of methodology. But she did finally make it through&mdash;just
because she was willing to fight it out. Now, you know, you can do
that&mdash;but it&rsquo;s tough. And some people really get killed.</p>

Fate of an Honest Intellectual<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I&rsquo;ll tell you
another, last case&mdash;and there are many others like this. Here&rsquo;s
a story which is really tragic. How many of you know about Joan
Peters, the book by Joan Peters? There was this best-seller a few
years ago [in 1984], it went through about ten printings, by a woman
named Joan Peters&mdash;or at least, <i>signed</i> by Joan
Peters&mdash;called <i>From Time Immemorial</i>.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">18</font></sup>
It was a big scholarly-looking book with lots of footnotes, which
purported to show that the Palestinians were all recent immigrants
[i.e. to the Jewish-settled areas of the former Palestine, during the
British mandate years of 1920 to 1948]. And it was <i>very</i>
popular&mdash;it got literally hundreds of rave reviews, and no
negative reviews: the <i>Washington Post</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>,
everybody was just raving about it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">19</font></sup>
Here was this book which proved that there were really no
Palestinians! Of course, the implicit message was, if Israel kicks
them all out there&rsquo;s no moral issue, because they&rsquo;re just
recent immigrants who came in because the Jews had built up the
country. And there was all kinds of demographic analysis in it, and a
big professor  of demography at the University of Chicago [Philip M.
Hauser] authenticated it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">20</font></sup>
That was the big intellectual hit for that year: Saul Bellow, Barbara
Tuchman, everybody was talking about it as the greatest thing since
chocolate cake.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">21</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, one graduate
student at Princeton, a guy named Norman Finkelstein, started reading
through the book. He was interested in the history of Zionism, and as
he read the book he was kind of surprised by some of the things it
said. He&rsquo;s a very careful student, and he started checking the
references&mdash;and it turned out that the whole thing was a hoax,
it was completely faked: probably it had been put together by some
intelligence agency or something like that. Well, Finkelstein wrote
up a short paper of just preliminary findings, it was about
twenty-five pages or so, and he sent it around to I think thirty
people who were interested in the topic, scholars in the field and so
on, saying: &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve found in this book,
do you think it&rsquo;s worth pursuing?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, he got back
one answer, from me. I told him, yeah, I think it&rsquo;s an
interesting topic, but I warned him, if you follow this, you&rsquo;re
going to get in trouble&mdash;because you&rsquo;re going to expose
the American intellectual community as a gang of frauds, and they are
not going to like it, and they&rsquo;re going to destroy you. So I
said: if you want to do it, go ahead, but be aware of what you&rsquo;re
getting into. It&rsquo;s an important issue, it makes a big
difference whether you eliminate the moral basis for driving out a
population&mdash;it&rsquo;s preparing the basis for some real
horrors&mdash;so a lot of people&rsquo;s lives could be at stake. But
your life is at stake too, I told him, because if you pursue this,
your career is going to be ruined.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, he didn&rsquo;t
believe me. We became very close friends after this, I didn&rsquo;t
know him before. He went ahead and wrote up an article, and he
started submitting it to journals. Nothing: they didn&rsquo;t even
bother responding. I finally managed to place a piece of it in <i>In
These Times</i>, a tiny left-wing journal published in Illinois,
where some of you may have seen it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">22</font></sup>
Otherwise nothing, no response. Meanwhile his professors&mdash;this
is Princeton University, supposed to be a serious place&mdash;stopped
talking to him: they wouldn&rsquo;t make appointments with him, they
wouldn&rsquo;t read his papers, he basically had to quit the program.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">By this time, he was
getting kind of desperate, and he asked me what to do. I gave him
what I thought was good advice, but what turned out to be bad advice:
I suggested that he shift over to a different department, where I
knew some people and figured he&rsquo;d at least be treated decently.
That turned out to be wrong. He switched over, and when he got to the
point of writing his thesis he literally could not get the faculty to
read it, he couldn&rsquo;t get them to come to his thesis defense.
Finally, out of embarrassment, they granted him a Ph.D.&mdash;he&rsquo;s
very smart, incidentally&mdash;but they will not even write a letter
for him saying that he was a student at Princeton University. I mean,
sometimes you have students for whom it&rsquo;s hard to write good
letters of recommendation, because you really didn&rsquo;t think they
were very good&mdash; but you can write <i>something</i>, there are
ways of doing these things. This guy was good, but he literally
cannot get a letter.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">He&rsquo;s now
living in a little apartment somewhere in New York City, and he&rsquo;s
a part-time social worker working with teenage drop-outs. Very
promising scholar&mdash;if he&rsquo;d done what he was told, he would
have gone on and right now he&rsquo;d be a professor somewhere at
some big university. Instead he&rsquo;s working part-time with
disturbed teenaged kids for a couple thousand dollars a year.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">23</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s a lot better than a death squad, it&rsquo;s true&mdash;it&rsquo;s
a whole lot better than a death squad. But those are the techniques
of control that are around.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But let me just go
on with the Joan Peters story. Finkelstein&rsquo;s very persistent:
he took a summer off and sat in the New York Public Library, where he
went through every single reference in the book&mdash;and he found a
record of fraud that you cannot believe. Well, the New York
intellectual community is a pretty small place, and pretty soon
everybody knew about this, everybody knew the book was a fraud and it
was going to be exposed sooner or later. The one journal that was
smart enough to react intelligently was the <i>New York Review of
Books</i>&mdash;they knew that the thing was a sham, but the editor
didn&rsquo;t want to offend his friends, so he just didn&rsquo;t run
a review at all. That was the one journal that <i>didn&rsquo;t</i>
run a review.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Meanwhile,
Finkelstein was being called in by big professors in the field who
were telling him, &ldquo;Look, call off your crusade; you drop this
and we&rsquo;ll take care of you, we&rsquo;ll make sure you get a
job,&rdquo; all this kind of stuff. But he kept doing it&mdash;he
kept on and on. Every time there was a favorable review, he&rsquo;d
write a letter to the editor which wouldn&rsquo;t get printed; he was
doing whatever he could do. We approached the publishers and asked
them if they were going to respond to any of this, and they said
no&mdash;and they were right. Why should they respond? They had the
whole system buttoned up, there was never going to be a critical word
about this in the United States. But then they made a technical
error: they allowed the book to appear in England, where you can&rsquo;t
control the intellectual community quite as easily.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, as soon as I
heard that the book was going to come out in England, I immediately
sent copies of Finkelstein&rsquo;s work to a number of British
scholars and journalists who are interested in the Middle East&mdash;and
they were ready. As soon as the book appeared, it was just
demolished, it was blown out of the water. Every major journal, the
<i>Times Literary Supplement,</i> the <i>London Review,</i> the
<i>Observer,</i> everybody had a review saying, this doesn&rsquo;t
even reach the level of nonsense, of idiocy. A lot of the criticism
used Finkelstein&rsquo;s work without any acknowledgment, I should
say&mdash;but about the kindest word anybody said about the book was
&ldquo;ludicrous,&rdquo; or &ldquo;preposterous.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">24</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, people here
read British reviews&mdash;if you&rsquo;re in the American
intellectual community, you read the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>
and the <i>London Review,</i> so it began to get a little
embarrassing. You started getting back-tracking: people started
saying, &ldquo;Well, look, I didn&rsquo;t really say the  book was
good, I just said it&rsquo;s an interesting topic,&rdquo; things like
that. At that point, the <i>New York Review</i> swung into action,
and they did what they always do in these circumstances. See, there&rsquo;s
like a routine that you go through&mdash;if a book gets blown out of
the water in England in places people here will see, or if a book
gets praised in England, you have to react. And if it&rsquo;s a book
on Israel, there&rsquo;s a standard way of doing it: you get an
Israeli scholar to review it. That&rsquo;s called covering your
ass&mdash;because whatever an Israeli scholar says, you&rsquo;re
pretty safe: no one can accuse the journal of anti-Semitism, none of
the usual stuff works.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So after the Peters
book got blown out of the water in England, the <i>New York Review</i>
assigned it to a good person actually, in fact Israel&rsquo;s leading
specialist on Palestinian nationalism [Yehoshua Porath], someone who
knows a lot about the subject. And he wrote a review, which they then
didn&rsquo;t publish&mdash;it went on for almost a year without the
thing being published; nobody knows exactly what was going on, but
you can guess that there must have been a lot of pressure not to
publish it. Eventually it was even written up in the <i>New York
Times</i> that this review wasn&rsquo;t getting published, so finally
some version of it did appear.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">25</font></sup>
It was critical, it said the book is nonsense and so on, but it cut
corners, the guy didn&rsquo;t say what he knew.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">26</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, the
Israeli reviews in general were extremely critical: the reaction of
the Israeli press was that they hoped the book would not be widely
read, because ultimately it would be harmful to the Jews&mdash;sooner
or later it would get exposed, and then it would just look like a
fraud and a hoax, and it would reflect badly on Israel.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">27</font></sup>
They underestimated the American intellectual community, I should
say.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Anyhow, by that
point the American intellectual community realized that the Peters
book was an embarrassment, and it sort of disappeared&mdash;nobody
talks about it anymore. I mean, you still find it at newsstands in
the airport and so on, but the best and the brightest know that they
are not supposed to talk about it anymore: because it was exposed and
they were exposed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the point is,
what happened to Finkelstein is the kind of thing that can happen
when you&rsquo;re an honest critic&mdash;and we could go on and on
with other cases like that. [Editors&rsquo; Note: Finkelstein has
since published several books with independent presses.]</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Still, in the
universities or in any other institution, you can often find some
dissidents hanging around in the woodwork&mdash;and they can survive
in one fashion or another, particularly if they get community
support. But if they become too disruptive or too obstreperous&mdash;or
you know, too effective&mdash;they&rsquo;re likely to be kicked out.
The standard thing, though, is that they won&rsquo;t make it within
the institutions in the first place, particularly if they were that
way when they were young&mdash;they&rsquo;ll simply be weeded out
somewhere along the line. So in most cases, the people who make it
through the institutions and are able to remain in them have already
internalized the  right kinds of beliefs: it&rsquo;s not a problem
for them to be obedient, they already are obedient, that&rsquo;s how
they got there. And that&rsquo;s pretty much how the ideological
control system perpetuates itself in the schools&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the basic story of how it operates, I think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8688_2032848809"></a>Forging
Working-Class Culture<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, I want
to turn for a moment to people who weren&rsquo;t sent through the
ideological control system of the schools, to see what kind of
independent minds people today should be struggling to foster. I&rsquo;ve
often heard you talk about the insights that guided the early labor
movement in the United States at the beginning of the industrial
revolution in the 1820s. You say that social movements today are
going to have to start by regaining some of that understanding. My
question is, who were those people exactly&mdash;was it mostly
European immigrants to the United States?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, it&rsquo;s what
were called at the time the &ldquo;Lowell mill-girls&rdquo;&mdash;meaning
young women who came off the farms to work in factories. In fact, a
good deal of the labor organizing in the nineteenth century in the
United States was done by women, because just like today in the Third
World, it was assumed that the most docile and controllable segment
of the workforce was women&mdash;so therefore they were the most
exploited.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember, the early
industrial revolution was built on textiles. It took off around
here&mdash;it was in Lowell and Lawrence [Massachusetts], places like
that. And very extensively the labor force was made up of women. In
fact, some of the main labor journals at the time were edited by
women, and they were young women mostly. And they were people who
wanted to read, they wanted to learn, they wanted to study&mdash;that
was just considered normal by working people back then. And they
wanted to have free lives. In fact, many of them didn&rsquo;t work in
the mills for very long&mdash;they&rsquo;d work there for a couple
years, then go back to some other life. But in the early stages of
the American labor movement, it was the Lowell mill-girls, or farmers
who were being driven off their farms by industry, who were the ones
who built up the early working-class culture.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">When the big waves
of European immigrants began to arrive in the United States, the
story started to change a bit, actually. See, the major wave of
immigration to the United States happened around the middle of the
nineteenth century, and the immigrants who were arriving were fleeing
from <i>extremely</i> impoverished parts of Europe&mdash;like
Ireland, for example. That was at the time of the Irish famine [of
1846-51], and Ireland was being absolutely devastated by it, so a lot
of people just escaped to North America if they could.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">People often forget,
Ireland&rsquo;s the oldest colony in the world: it could have been a
rich place, just like England, but it&rsquo;s been a colony for 800
years, and it&rsquo;s one of the few parts of the world that was not
only <i>underdeveloped</i> , like most colonies, but also
<i>depopulated</i>&mdash;Ireland now has about half the population it
had in the early nineteenth century, in fact. And the Irish famine
was an economists&rsquo; famine&mdash;Ireland was actually exporting
food to England during the famine, because the sacred principles of
Political Economy said that that&rsquo;s the way it has to be: if
there&rsquo;s a better market for it in England, that&rsquo;s where
the food has to go, and you certainly couldn&rsquo;t send food <i>to</i>
Ireland, because that would have interfered with the market.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">28</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So there was mass
starvation taking place in Ireland, and the Irish immigrants who were
coming to the United States were desperate for work, so they could be
forced to work for essentially nothing&mdash;the same was also true
of a lot of the people who were coming here from Southern and Eastern
Europe. And that undercut the early labor movement to a significant
extent&mdash;I mean, the Lowell mill-girls could not, or would not,
work at the level of the millions of immigrants who were coming in.
So it took a long time before you started to get the growth of labor
organizing here again, because the domestic workforce could just be
displaced whenever it started to protest.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the poor
immigrants who came here were treated like dogs&mdash;I mean,
miserably treated. So for example, Irish women were used for
experimentation in Mengele-style experiments in the United States in
the nineteenth century [Mengele was a Nazi doctor who &ldquo;experimented&rdquo;
on live human beings]. That&rsquo;s not a joke&mdash;gynecological
surgery was literally developed by Mengeles, who used subjects like
indigent Irish women or slaves, and just subjected them to experiment
after experiment, like thirty experiments, to try to figure out how
to make the procedures work. In fact, doctors exactly like Joseph
Mengele were <i>honored</i> for that in the United States&mdash;you
still see their pictures up on the walls in medical schools.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">29</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So it wasn&rsquo;t a
European input that brought about the American labor movement, quite
the opposite. But I mean, these were just natural reactions: you
didn&rsquo;t have to have any training to understand these things,
you didn&rsquo;t have to read Marx or anything like that. It&rsquo;s
just degrading to have to follow orders, and to be stuck in a place
where you slave for twelve hours a day, then go to a dormitory where
they watch your morals and so on&mdash;which is what it was like.
People simply regarded that as degrading.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It was the same with
craftsmen, people who had been self-employed and were now being
forced into the factories&mdash;they wanted to be able to run their
own lives. I mean, shoemakers would hire people to read to them while
they were working&mdash;and that didn&rsquo;t mean read Stephen King
or something, it meant read real stuff. These were people who had
libraries, and they wanted to live lives, they wanted to control
their own work&mdash;but they were being forced into
shoe-manufacturing plants in places like Lowell where they were
treated, not even like animals, like machines. And that was
degrading, and demeaning&mdash;and they fought against it. And
incidentally, they weren&rsquo;t fighting against it so much because
it was reducing their  economic level, which it wasn&rsquo;t (in fact
it was probably raising it)&mdash;it was because it was taking power
out of their hands, and subordinating them to others, and turning
them into mindless tools of production. And they didn&rsquo;t want
that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, if you want
to do some really interesting reading, one book I would suggest is
the first book of labor history that was written&mdash;ever, I think.
It came out in 1924, and it was just republished in Chicago: it&rsquo;s
called <i>The Industrial Worker</i>, by Norman Ware, and it&rsquo;s
mostly excerpts from the independent labor press in the United States
in the mid-nineteenth century. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">30</font></sup>
See, there was a big independent workers&rsquo; press in the United
States at the time&mdash;it was about at the scale of the capitalist
press, actually&mdash;and it was run by what were called &ldquo;factory
girls,&rdquo; or by craftsmen. And it&rsquo;s extremely interesting
to look at.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Right through the
nineteenth century, working people in the United States were
struggling against the imposition of what they described as
&ldquo;degradation,&rdquo; &ldquo;oppression,&rdquo; &ldquo;wage
slavery,&rdquo; &ldquo;taking away our elementary rights,&rdquo;
&ldquo;turning us into tools of production,&rdquo; everything that we
now call modern capitalism (which is in fact state-capitalism) they
fought against for a full century&mdash;and very bitterly, it was an
extremely hard struggle. And they were calling for &ldquo;labor
republicanism&rdquo;&mdash;you know, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to
the days when we were free people.&rdquo; &ldquo;Labor&rdquo; just
means &ldquo;people,&rdquo; after all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And in fact, they
also were fighting against the imposition of the mass public
education system&mdash;and rightly, because they understood exactly
what it was: a technique to beat independence out of the heads of
farmers and to turn them into docile and obedient factory workers.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">31</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s ultimately why public education was instituted in the
United States in the first place: to meet the needs of newly-emerging
industry. See, part of the process of trying to develop a degraded
and obedient labor force was to make the workers stupid and
passive&mdash;and mass education was one of the ways that was
achieved. And of course, there was also a much broader effort to
destroy the independent working-class intellectual culture that had
developed, which ranged from a huge amount of just outright force, to
more subtle techniques like propaganda and public relations
campaigns.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And those efforts
have been sustained right to this day, in fact. So labor unions have
by now been virtually wiped out in the United States, in part by a
huge amount of business propaganda, running from cinema to almost
everything, and through a lot of other techniques as well. But the
whole process took a long time&mdash;I&rsquo;m old enough to remember
what the working-class culture was like in the United States: there
was still a high level of it when I was growing up in the late 1930s.
It took a long time to beat it out of workers&rsquo; heads and turn
them into passive tools; it took a long time to make people accept
that this type of exploitation is the only alternative, so they&rsquo;d
better just forget about their rights and say, &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m
degraded.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the first thing
that has to happen, I think, is we have to recover some of that old
understanding. I mean, it all starts with cultural changes. We  have
to dismantle all of this stuff culturally: we&rsquo;ve got to change
people&rsquo;s minds, their spirits, and help them recover what was
common understanding in a more civilized period, like a century ago
on the shop floors of Lowell. If that kind of understanding could be
natural among a huge part of the general population in the nineteenth
century, it can be natural again today. And it&rsquo;s something
we&rsquo;ve really got to work on now.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8690_2032848809"></a>The
Fraud of Modern Economics<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, you
mentioned Ireland being forced to export food to England during the
Irish famine because of the supposed demands of the free market. How
exactly did that kind of &ldquo;free market&rdquo; economic thinking
get instituted as legitimate in the universities and in the popular
ideology as a whole over the years&mdash;for instance, the work of
the Social Darwinists [who claimed that natural selection and
&ldquo;survival of the fittest&rdquo; determine individual and
societal wealth], and of Malthus [early-nineteenth-century economist
who argued that poverty was inevitable and population growth should
be checked by famine, war, and disease], and others who in various
ways blamed the poor for being poor?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Malthus gets kind of
a bad press, actually: he&rsquo;s singled out as the guy who said
that people should just be left to starve if they can&rsquo;t support
themselves&mdash;but really that was pretty much the line of
classical economics in general. In fact, Malthus was one of the
founders of classical economics, right alongside of guys like David
Ricardo.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Malthus&rsquo;s
point was basically this: if you don&rsquo;t have independent wealth,
and you can&rsquo;t sell your labor on the market at a level at which
you can survive, then you have no right being here&mdash;go to the
workhouse prison or go somewhere else. And in those days, &ldquo;go
somewhere else&rdquo; meant go to North America, or to Australia, and
so on. Now, he wasn&rsquo;t saying it was anyone&rsquo;s <i>fault</i>
if they were poor and had to remove themselves; he was saying, it&rsquo;s
a law of nature that this is the way it has to be.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">32</font></sup>
Ricardo in fact said that it was true at the level of &ldquo;the
principle of gravitation&rdquo;&mdash;and of course, to try to
interfere with a law of nature like that only makes things worse.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">33</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So what both Malthus
and Ricardo were arguing, sort of in parallel, was that you only harm
the poor by making them believe that they have rights other than what
they can win on the market, like a basic right to live, because that
kind of right interferes with the market, and with efficiency, and
with growth and so on&mdash;so ultimately people will just be worse
off if you try to recognize them. And as you suggest, those ideas are
basically still taught today&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think the
free-market ideology that&rsquo;s taught in university economics
departments right now is very much different. Sure, you have more
mathematical formulas and so on today, but really it&rsquo;s pretty
much the same story.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But how did
that thinking get instituted?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">How did it get
instituted? As a weapon of class warfare. Actually, the history of
this is kind of intriguing&mdash;and as far as I know, there&rsquo;s
only one book about it: it&rsquo;s by a good economic historian named
Rajani Kanth, who was just rewarded for his efforts by being thrown
out of the University of Utah. But he goes through it all, and it&rsquo;s
very revealing.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">34</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You see, during the
early stages of the industrial revolution, as England was coming out
of a feudal-type society and into what&rsquo;s basically a
state-capitalist system, the rising bourgeoisie there had a problem.
In a traditional society like the feudal system, people had a certain
place, and they had certain rights&mdash;in fact, they had what was
called at the time a &ldquo;right to live.&rdquo; I mean, under
feudalism it may have been a <i>lousy</i> right, but nevertheless
people were assumed to have some natural entitlement for survival.
But with the rise of what we call capitalism, that right had to be
destroyed: people had to have it knocked out of their heads that they
had any automatic &ldquo;right to live&rdquo; beyond what they could
win for themselves on the labor market. And that was the main point
of classical economics. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">35</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember the context
in which all of this was taking place: classical economics developed
after a period in which a large part of the English population had
been forcibly driven off the land they had been farming for
centuries&mdash;that was <i>by force</i>, it wasn&rsquo;t a pretty
picture [i.e. intensive enclosure of communal lands by acts of
Parliament occurred between 1750 and 1860]. In fact, very likely one
of the main reasons why England led the industrial revolution was
just that they had been much more violent in driving people off the
land than in other places. For instance, in France a lot of people
were able to remain on the land, and therefore they resisted
industrialization more.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">36</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But even after the
rising bourgeoisie in England had driven millions of peasants off the
land, there was a period when the population&rsquo;s &ldquo;right to
live&rdquo; still was preserved by what we would today call
&ldquo;welfare.&rdquo; There was a set of laws in England which gave
people rights, called the &ldquo;Poor Laws&rdquo; [initially and most
comprehensively codified in 1601]&mdash;which essentially kept you
alive if you couldn&rsquo;t survive otherwise; they provided sort of
a minimum level of subsistence, like subsidies on food and so on. And
there was also something called the &ldquo;Corn Laws&rdquo; [dating
in varying forms from the twelfth century], which gave landlords
certain rights beyond those they could get on the market&mdash;they
raised the price of corn, that sort of thing. And together, these
laws were considered among the main impediments to the new rising
British industrial class&mdash;so therefore they just had to go.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, those people
needed an ideology to support their effort to knock out of people&rsquo;s
heads the idea that they had this basic right to live, and that&rsquo;s
what classical economics was about&mdash;classical economics said: no
one has any right to live, you only have a right to what you can gain
for yourself on the labor market. And the founders of classical
economics in fact said  they&rsquo;d developed a &ldquo;scientific
theory&rdquo; of it, with&mdash;as they put it&mdash;&ldquo;the
certainty of the principle of gravitation.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, by the
1830s, political conditions in England had changed enough so that the
rising bourgeoisie were able to kill the Poor Laws [they were
significantly limited in 1832], and then later they managed to do
away with the Corn Laws [in 1846]. And by around 1840 or 1845, they
won the elections and took over the government. Then at that point, a
very interesting thing happened. They gave up the theory, and
Political Economy changed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It changed for a
number of reasons. For one thing, these guys had won, so they didn&rsquo;t
need it so much as an ideological weapon anymore. For another, they
recognized that they themselves needed a powerful interventionist
state to defend industry from the hardships of competition in the
open market&mdash;as they always <i>had</i> in fact. And beyond that,
eliminating people&rsquo;s &ldquo;right to live&rdquo; was starting
to have some negative side-effects. First of all, it was causing
riots all over the place: for a long period, the British army was
mostly preoccupied with putting down riots across England. Then
something even worse happened&mdash;the population started to
organize: you got the beginnings of an organized labor movement, and
later the Chartist movement [an 1838-48 popular campaign for
Parliamentary reform], and then a socialist movement developed. And
at that point, the elites in England recognized that the game just
had to be called off, or else they <i>really</i> would be in
trouble&mdash;so by the time you get to the second half of the
nineteenth century, things like John Stuart Mill&rsquo;s <i>Principles
of Political Economy,</i> which gives kind of a social-democratic
line, were becoming the reigning ideology.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, the &ldquo;science&rdquo;
happens to be a very flexible one: you can change it to do whatever
you feel like, it&rsquo;s that kind of &ldquo;science.&rdquo; So by
the middle of the nineteenth century, the &ldquo;science&rdquo; had
changed, and now it turned out that laissez faire [the idea that the
economy functions best without government interference] was a bad
thing after all&mdash;and what you got instead were the intellectual
foundations for what&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;welfare state.&rdquo;
And in fact, for a century afterwards, &ldquo;laissez faire&rdquo;
was basically a dirty word&mdash;nobody talked about it anymore. And
what the &ldquo;science&rdquo; now said was that you had better give
the population some way of surviving, or else they&rsquo;re going to
challenge your right to rule. You can take away their right to live,
but then they&rsquo;re going to take away your right to rule&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s no good, so ways have to be found to accommodate them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it wasn&rsquo;t
until recent years that laissez-faire ideology was revived again&mdash;and
again, it was as a weapon of class warfare. I mean, as far as I can
see, the principles of classical economics in effect are still
taught: I don&rsquo;t think what&rsquo;s taught in the University of
Chicago Economics Department today is all that different, what&rsquo;s
called &ldquo;neo-liberalism&rdquo; [an economic stance stressing
cutbacks in social services, stable currencies, and balanced
budgets]. And it doesn&rsquo;t have any more validity than it had in
the early nineteenth  century&mdash;in fact, it has even <i>less.</i>
At least in the early nineteenth century, Ricardo&rsquo;s and
Malthus&rsquo;s assumptions had <i>some</i> relation to reality.
Today those assumptions have <i>no</i> relation to reality.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look: the basic
assumption of the classical economists was that labor is highly
mobile and capital is relatively immobile&mdash;that&rsquo;s
required, that&rsquo;s crucial to proving all their nice theorems.
That was the reason they could say, &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t get
enough to survive on the labor market, go someplace else&rdquo;&mdash;because
you <i>could</i> go someplace else: after the native populations of
places like the United States and Australia and Tasmania were
exterminated or driven away, then yeah, poor Europeans could go
someplace else. So in the early nineteenth century, labor was indeed
mobile. And back then, capital was indeed <i>immobile</i>&mdash;first
because &ldquo;capital&rdquo; primarily meant land, and you can&rsquo;t
move land, and also because to the extent that there was investment,
it was very local: like, you didn&rsquo;t have communications systems
that allowed for easy transfers of money all around the world, like
we do today.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So in the early
nineteenth century, the assumption that labor is mobile and capital
is immobile was more or less realistic&mdash;and on the basis of that
assumption, you could try to prove things about comparative advantage
and all this stuff you learn in school about Portugal and wine and so
on [Ricardo&rsquo;s most famous hypothetical for demonstrating how
free trade could be mutually advantageous to participating countries
involved England concentrating on selling cloth and Portugal wine].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Incidentally, if you
want to know how well those theorems actually work, just compare
Portugal and England after a hundred years of trying them out&mdash;growing
wine versus industrializing as possible modes of development. But
let&rsquo;s put that aside . . .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, by now the
assumptions underpinning these theories are not only <i>false</i>&mdash;they&rsquo;re
the <i>opposite</i> of the truth. By now labor is <i>immobile</i>,
through immigration restrictions and so on, and capital is highly
<i>mobile</i>, primarily because of technological changes. So none of
the results work anymore. But you&rsquo;re still taught them, you&rsquo;re
still taught the theories exactly as before&mdash;even though the
reality today is the exact opposite of what was assumed in the early
nineteenth century. I mean, if you look at some of the fancier
economists, Paul Krugman and so on, they&rsquo;ve got all kinds of
little tricks here and there to make the results not quite so
grotesquely ridiculous as they&rsquo;d otherwise be. But
fundamentally, it all just is pretty ridiculous.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, if capital
is mobile and labor is immobile, there&rsquo;s no reason why mobile
capital shouldn&rsquo;t seek <i>absolute</i> advantage and play one
national workforce against another, go wherever the labor is cheapest
and thereby drive <i>everybody&rsquo;s</i> standard of living down.
In fact, that&rsquo;s exactly what we&rsquo;re seeing in N.A.F.T.A.
[the North American Free Trade Agreement] and all these other
international trade agreements which are being instituted right now.
Nothing in these abstract economic models actually <i>works</i> in
the real world. It doesn&rsquo;t matter how many footnotes they put
in, or how many ways  they tinker around the edges. The whole
enterprise is totally rotten at the core: it has no relation to
reality anymore&mdash;and furthermore, it never did.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0.23in; line-height: 115%">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt"><b><i>The</i> <i>Real</i>
<i>Market</i> </b></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So take a look at
one of the things you don&rsquo;t say if you&rsquo;re an economist
within one of the ideological institutions, although surely every
economist has to know it. Take the fact that there is not a single
case on record in history of any country that has developed
successfully through adherence to &ldquo;free market&rdquo;
principles: none. Certainly not the United States. I mean, the United
States has always had <i>extensive</i> state intervention in the
economy, right from the earliest days&mdash;we would be exporting fur
right now if we were following the principles of comparative
advantage.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, the reason why
the industrial revolution took off in places like Lowell and Lawrence
is because of high protectionist tariffs the U.S. government set up
to keep out British goods. And the same thing runs right up to today:
like, we would not have successful high-tech industry in the United
States today if it wasn&rsquo;t for a huge public subsidy to advanced
industry, mostly through the Pentagon system and N.A.S.A. and so
on&mdash;that doesn&rsquo;t have the vaguest relation to a &ldquo;free
market.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, if you want
a good illustration, just read today&rsquo;s <i>New York Times.</i>
There&rsquo;s a story on the business page about how we&rsquo;ve got
a funny kind of economic recovery going on in the country right now:
there&rsquo;s a lot of economic growth, but not many good new
jobs&mdash;you know, big surprise. And they use one factory as an
example, a stove factory that&rsquo;s being set up in Tulsa by the
Whirlpool corporation. Well, the last paragraph of the article points
out how the &ldquo;free market&rdquo; really works: the reason why
Whirlpool decided to put the factory in Tulsa instead of, say, in
Mexico, is that the taxpayers in Tulsa County are going to pay 25
percent of the corporation&rsquo;s capital costs.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">37</font></sup>
Okay, that&rsquo;s how the free market <i>really</i> works&mdash;in
fact, that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s <i>always</i> worked, from the
early days of the industrial revolution right up until this morning,
without any known exception. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">38</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As a matter of fact,
the United States has been the most economically protectionist
country in history. We&rsquo;ve traditionally had the highest
protectionist tariffs in the world, so much so that one leading
economic historian in a recent book (published by the University of
Chicago Press, no less) describes us as &ldquo;the mother country and
bastion of modern protectionism.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">39</font></sup>
So for example, in the late nineteenth century, when Europe was
actually toying around with laissez faire for a brief period,
American tariffs were five to ten times as high as theirs&mdash;and
that was the fastest economic growth period in American history. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">40</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And it goes on right
until the present. The United States developed a steel industry a
century ago because it radically violated the rules of the &ldquo;free
market,&rdquo; and it was able to recover its steel industry in the
last decade or so  by doing things like restricting imports from
abroad, destroying labor unions to drive down wages, and slamming
huge tariffs on foreign steel.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">41</font></sup>
I mean, the Reaganites always talked enthusiastically about &ldquo;market
forces,&rdquo; but they refused to allow them to function&mdash;and
for a very simple reason: if market forces had been allowed to
function, the United States would no longer have an automobile
industry, or a microchip industry, or computers, or electronics,
because they would have just been wiped out by the Japanese. So
therefore the Reaganites closed off American markets and poured in
huge amounts of public funds. And actually, they were perfectly frank
about it to the business community&mdash;though of course, not to the
public. So when he was Secretary of the Treasury, James Baker proudly
proclaimed to a business audience in 1987 that Ronald Reagan &ldquo;has
granted more import relief to U.S. industry than any of his
predecessors in more than half a century&rdquo;&mdash;which was far
too modest, actually; Reagan probably provided more import relief to
industry than all his predecessors <i>combined</i> in that period.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">42</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Of course, the &ldquo;free
market&rdquo; ideology is very <i>useful</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
weapon against the general population here, because it&rsquo;s an
argument against social spending, and it&rsquo;s a weapon against
poor people abroad, because we can hold it up to them and say &ldquo;You
guys have to follow these rules,&rdquo; then just go ahead and rob
them. But nobody really pays any attention to this stuff when it
comes to actual planning&mdash;and no one ever has.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So there was just a
British study of the hundred leading transnational corporations in
the &ldquo;<i>Fortune</i> 500,&rdquo; and it found that of the
hundred, every single one of them had benefited from what&rsquo;s
called &ldquo;state industrial policy&rdquo;&mdash;that is, from some
form of government intervention in the country in which they&rsquo;re
based. And of the hundred, they said at least twenty had been saved
from total collapse by state intervention at one point or another.
For instance, the Lockheed corporation was going under in the early
1970s, and the Nixon administration just bailed them out with public
funds.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">43</font></sup>
Okay, so they&rsquo;re back in business. And now they <i>stay</i> in
business because the public pays for C-130s [military aircraft], and
upgrading F-16s, and the F-22 project, and so on&mdash;none of which
has anything to do with a &ldquo;free market&rdquo; either.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take the fact
that so many people live in the suburbs and everybody has to drive
their own car everywhere. Was that a result of the &ldquo;free
market&rdquo;? No, it was because the U.S. government carried out a
massive social-engineering project in the 1950s to destroy the public
transportation system in favor of expanding a highly inefficient
system based on cars and airplanes&mdash;because that&rsquo;s what
benefits big industry. It started with corporate conspiracies to buy
up and eliminate streetcar systems, and then continued with huge
public subsidies to build the highway system and encourage an
extremely inefficient and environmentally destructive alternative.
That&rsquo;s what led to the suburbanization of the country&mdash;so
you get huge shopping malls in the suburbs, and devastation in the
inner cities.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">44</font></sup>
 But these policies were a result of planning&mdash;they had nothing
to do with the &ldquo;free market.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, the most
dramatic example of these &ldquo;market distortions&rdquo; that I can
think of&mdash;which I suspect is never even taught in economics
courses&mdash;concerns the reason why the United States had an
industrial revolution in the first place. Remember, the industrial
revolution was fueled by textiles, meaning one commodity: cotton. And
cotton was cheap, that was crucially important. Well, why was cotton
cheap? Was it because of market forces? No. Cotton was cheap because
they exterminated the native population here and brought in
slaves&mdash;that&rsquo;s why cotton was cheap. Genocide and slavery:
try to imagine a more severe market distortion than that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Other countries who
had their own cotton resources also tried to start on industrial
revolutions&mdash;but they didn&rsquo;t get very far, because England
had more guns, and stopped them by force. Egypt, for example, had its
own cotton resources, and started on an industrial revolution at
about the same time as the United States did, around 1820&mdash;but
the British weren&rsquo;t going to tolerate an economic competitor in
the Eastern Mediterranean, so they just stopped it by force. Okay, no
industrial revolution in Egypt.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">45</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The same thing also
happened in Britain&rsquo;s earliest &ldquo;experiment&rdquo; with
these ideas, in what was called Bengal, in India. In fact, Bengal was
one of the first places colonized in the eighteenth century, and when
Robert Clive [British conqueror] first landed there, he described it
as a paradise: Dacca, he said, is just like London, and they in fact
referred to it as &ldquo;the Manchester of India.&rdquo; It was rich
and populous, there was high-quality cotton, agriculture, advanced
industry, a lot of resources, jute, all sorts of things&mdash;it was
in fact comparable to England in its manufacturing level, and really
looked like it was going to take off. Well, look at it today: Dacca,
&ldquo;the Manchester of India,&rdquo; is the capital of
Bangladesh&mdash;the absolute symbol of disaster.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">46</font></sup>
And that&rsquo;s because the British just despoiled the country and
destroyed it, by the equivalent of what we would today call
&ldquo;structural adjustment&rdquo; [i.e. economic policies from the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund which expose Third World
economies to foreign penetration and control].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, India
generally was a real competitor with England: as late as the 1820s,
the British were learning advanced techniques of steel-making there,
India was building ships for the British navy at the time of the
Napoleonic Wars [1803-1815], they had a developed textiles industry,
they were producing more iron than all of Europe combined&mdash;so
the British just proceeded to de-industrialize the country by force
and turn it into an impoverished rural society.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">47</font></sup>
Was that competition in the &ldquo;free market&rdquo;?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And it goes on and
on: the United States annexed Texas [in 1845], and one of the main
reasons for that was to ensure that the U.S. achieved a monopoly on
cotton&mdash;which was the oil of the nineteenth century, it was what
really fueled the industrial economies. So the American leadership
figured that if they could take Texas, which was a major
cotton-producing area,  then they would be able to strangle England
economically. See, England was the main enemy at that time, they
hated England: it was much more powerful militarily than the United
States, it kept us from conquering Canada and seizing Cuba the way
elites here wanted to&mdash;and in fact, the only reason the American
colonists had been able to defeat England in the American Revolution
in the first place was that the French military had massively
intervened in the colonial uprising here to help overthrow British
power.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">48</font></sup> So
England was the real enemy. And if you read the Jacksonian Democrats,
Presidents Polk and Tyler and so on, they were saying: if we can get
Texas, we can bring England to our feet and gain mastery of the trade
of the world. In fact, the worst charges, paranoid charges, that were
leveled against Saddam Hussein before the Gulf War apply precisely to
the Jacksonian Democrats: they wanted to monopolize the main resource
of the world so they could bring everybody else to their feet.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">49</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And exactly the same
lessons apply today. Today it&rsquo;s oil that&rsquo;s at the center
of the industrial economies. And why is oil cheap? Well, that&rsquo;s
what you pay your taxes for: a large part of the Pentagon system
exists to make sure that oil prices stay within a certain range&mdash;not
too low, because Western economies and energy corporations depend on
the profits from it, but not too high, because that might interfere
with what&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; of
international trade [i.e. because transport and other costs of trade
rise with the oil price]. Well, trade is only &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;
because a lot of force and international violence keeps oil prices
from going too high, so if you really wanted to measure the
&ldquo;efficiency of trade,&rdquo; you&rsquo;d have to figure in all
of the other costs which <i>make</i> it that way, like the costs of
the Pentagon for one. And if anyone ever did that, you couldn&rsquo;t
<i>possibly</i> say that trade is &ldquo;efficient.&rdquo; If anybody
ever bothered to calculate these things, the efficiency of trade
would drop very, very low, and it would in fact prove to be extremely
<i>inefficient.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, these market
distortions are not footnotes&mdash;they are absolutely huge
phenomena. Nobody ever tries to estimate them, because economics is
not a serious field&mdash;but people in the business world know about
them perfectly well, which is why they&rsquo;ve always called upon a
powerful state to protect them from market discipline: they don&rsquo;t
want market discipline any more than they want democratic control,
and they&rsquo;ve always blocked it. And the same is true of just
about every aspect of any developed economy there is.</p>

<font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt"><b><i>Automation</i> </b></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, let&rsquo;s
just take one last case of this, an extremely important and revealing
one: let&rsquo;s look at automation. I mean, it&rsquo;s standardly
claimed these days that the reason why the population is suffering,
why people have been losing jobs at a mad rate, real wages have been
going down for the last twenty-five years and so on, is due to, as
Ricardo said, &ldquo;laws like the principle  of
gravitation&rdquo;&mdash;inexorable market forces are making it that
way, like automation, or the efficiency of international trade.
That&rsquo;s the standard argument: these things are inevitable
because the market is just imposing them on us.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">50</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s all total bullshit. I mentioned one reason why the
&ldquo;efficiency of trade&rdquo; argument is mostly a fraud, now
let&rsquo;s look at automation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it&rsquo;s
true that automation is &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;&mdash;like, by market
principles, automation saves businessmen money and drives workers out
of jobs. But it didn&rsquo;t <i>get</i> that way because of the
market, not at all: it only got that way through intensive and
prolonged funding and development through the state sector&mdash;that&rsquo;s
market <i>distortion.</i> I mean, for thirty years automation was
developed through the military system in the United States, and the
reason why it took so long and cost so much is that automation was so
<i>inefficient</i> to begin with that it couldn&rsquo;t possibly have
survived in the market&mdash;so therefore automation was developed
the same way we develop most high technology: through the public
sector.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, in the Air
Force and the Navy (where most of this took place), nobody <i>cares</i>
about costs&mdash;because the taxpayer&rsquo;s paying, so the
development can be as expensive and inefficient as you like. And in
that way, they were able to develop automation to the point where it
could then be used to drive people out of work and make profits for
corporations. For instance, take the history of automated numerical
control of metal-cutting machines [i.e. translation of part
specifications into mathematical information that can be fed into
machines without the need for skilled machinists]. That was developed
through the Air Force, it went on for decades, and finally it got
efficient enough so that it could be handed over to the corporations
and they could then throw out their workers. But it didn&rsquo;t
happen through market forces, not at all&mdash;it was the result of
massive state intervention.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Furthermore, if you
look at the <i>kind</i> of automation that was developed, you see
precisely what workers in the early labor movement were complaining
about: being turned into mindless tools of production. I mean,
automation could have been designed in such a way as to <i>use</i>
the skills of skilled machinists and to eliminate management&mdash;there&rsquo;s
nothing inherent in automation that says it can&rsquo;t be used that
way. But it wasn&rsquo;t, believe me; it was used in exactly the
opposite way. Automation was designed through the state system to
demean and degrade people&mdash;to de-skill workers and increase
managerial control. And again, that had nothing to do with the
market, and it had nothing to do with the nature of the technology:
it had to do with straight power interests. So the <i>kind</i> of
automation that was developed in places like the M.I.T. Engineering
Department was very carefully designed so that it would create
interchangeable workers and enhance managerial control&mdash;and that
was not for economic reasons.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">51</font></sup>
I mean, study after study, including by management firms like Arthur
D. Little and so on, show that managers have selected automation even
when it <i>cuts back</i> on profits&mdash;just because it gives them
more control over their workforce.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">52</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you&rsquo;re
interested, there&rsquo;s been some very interesting work done on
this; the guy who&rsquo;s done the best work is David Noble&mdash;for
his sins he was  denied tenure at M.I.T., and now he&rsquo;s teaching
in Canada. He wrote a book called <i>Forces of Production</i>, which
is a pretty specialized technical analysis mainly of the development
of numerical control of machinery, but he&rsquo;s also got a good
popular book out, called <i>Progress Without People: In Defense of
Luddism.</i> Unfortunately, this is the kind of book that&rsquo;s
published like in Katmandu or something&mdash;it&rsquo;s published by
a very small anarchist press in Chicago. But it&rsquo;s very
interesting, didn&rsquo;t make him too popular in the Faculty Club
and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">53</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">One of the things he
discusses there is Luddism [a movement of English workers who wrecked
industrial machines, which began in 1811]. See, the Luddites are
always accused of having wanted to <i>destroy</i> machinery, but it&rsquo;s
been known in scholarship for a long time that that&rsquo;s not
true&mdash;what they really wanted to do was to prevent <i>themselves</i>
from being de-skilled, and Noble talks about this in his book. The
Luddites had nothing against machinery itself, they just didn&rsquo;t
want it to destroy <i>them</i>, they wanted it to be developed in
such a way that it would enhance their skills and their power, and
not degrade and destroy them&mdash;which of course makes perfect
sense. And that sentiment runs right throughout the working-class
movements of the nineteenth century, actually&mdash;and you can even
see it today.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, if economics
were like a real field, these are the kinds of things they would be
studying. None of it is very complicated&mdash;like, everybody knows
why cotton was cheap, for instance: everybody who went to elementary
school knows why cotton was cheap, and if it hadn&rsquo;t been for
cheap cotton, there wouldn&rsquo;t have been an industrial
revolution. It&rsquo;s not hard. But I&rsquo;d be very surprised if
anybody teaches this stuff in economics courses in the United States.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, sure, there
are some market forces operating&mdash;but the reality is, they&rsquo;re
pretty much off around the edges. And when people talk about the
progress of automation and free-market &ldquo;trade forces&rdquo;
inevitably kicking all these people out of work and driving the whole
world towards kind of a Third World-type polarization of wealth&mdash;I
mean, that&rsquo;s true if you take a narrow enough perspective on
it. But if you look into the factors that <i>made</i> things the way
they are, it doesn&rsquo;t even come <i>close</i> to being true, it&rsquo;s
not even remotely in touch with reality. But when you&rsquo;re
studying economics in the ideological institutions, that&rsquo;s all
just irrelevant and you&rsquo;re not supposed to ask questions like
these: you have all the information right in front of you, but these
are simply not matters that it is proper to spend time talking about.</p>

Revolutionary Change in Moral Values<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, given
an intellectual culture like the one you&rsquo;ve been describing&mdash;can
you find any &ldquo;honest&rdquo; intellectuals in the U.S.?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You can find them,
but like I say, usually they&rsquo;re not inside the institutions&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s for a very good reason: there is no reason why
institutions of power and domination should tolerate or encourage
people who try to undermine them. That would be completely
dysfunctional. So typically you&rsquo;re going to find major efforts
made to marginalize the honest and serious intellectuals, the people
who are committed to what I would call Enlightenment values&mdash;values
of truth, and freedom, and liberty, and justice. And those efforts
will to a large extent succeed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Who are
those people? I mean, you make the whole situation look very
bleak&mdash;who would you say are the intellectuals that are going
about things in the right way?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, very often
they&rsquo;re the people who have done things to make a real change
in the world. Take the S.N.C.C. [Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee] activists, for example&mdash;they were serious
intellectuals, and they made a big change. Or take the people in the
1960s who did the work that&rsquo;s led to so many of the
improvements we&rsquo;ve seen in the country over the last twenty
years&mdash;and &ldquo;work&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t just mean running
around the streets waving signs, you know, it also meant thinking
about things, and figuring out what the problems were, and trying to
teach people about them and convince them. Despite what you always
hear, that was <i>not</i> elite intellectuals: the liberal
intellectual community in the United States was always <i>strongly</i>
opposed to the people who protested the American aggression in
Indochina on principled grounds, they were <i>not</i> the ones
assisting the popular movements. Well, those people were serious
intellectuals, in my view.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you see, there is
sort of an &ldquo;honest&rdquo; left intelligentsia, if you
like&mdash;meaning intellectuals who are not serving power as either
a Red Bureaucracy, or as state-capitalist commissar-equivalents. It&rsquo;s
just that most of the time they&rsquo;re outside the institutions&mdash;and
for almost trivial reasons: you&rsquo;re not going to find a militant
labor activist as Chairman of the Board of General Electric, right?
Yeah, how could there be? But there are people all over the place who
are honest and committed, and are thinking about the world, and
trying to change it&mdash;many more today than there were thirty
years ago, in fact.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, it&rsquo;s
standardly claimed that there&rsquo;s less of a left intelligentsia
around today in the United States than there was in the Fifties and
Sixties&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t believe a word of it. I think the
opposite is true, actually. Just take a look at the people who
they&rsquo;re <i>calling</i> the big thinkers of the 1950s: who were
they? They were intelligent people, like Edmund Wilson&rsquo;s an
intelligent person&mdash;but <i>left intellectual</i>? Or Mary
McCarthy: yeah, smart person, wrote some nice novels&mdash;but not a
left intellectual. In fact, what you have now is much more serious
activists all over the place, people who are thinking carefully about
important questions, and who understand a lot.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I travel around all
the time giving talks, and throughout the 1980s I was <i>amazed</i>
to go to places and see it. Take the Central America solidarity
movement, which was a pretty dramatic development&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
think there&rsquo;s ever been anything like it in history, in fact.
I&rsquo;d go to a church in Kansas, or some town in Montana or
Wyoming or something, Anchorage, Alaska, and find people there who
know more about Latin America certainly than the C.I.A., which isn&rsquo;t
very hard actually, but more than people in the academic departments
of universities. They&rsquo;re people who&rsquo;ve thought about it,
and who&rsquo;ve understood things, and brought a lot of intelligence
to the issues&mdash;I can&rsquo;t even tell you their names, there
are too many of them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, I&rsquo;m not
even sure the word &ldquo;left&rdquo; is the right word for them: a
lot of them were probably Christian conservatives, but they were very
radical people in my view, and intellectuals who understood, and who
did a lot. They created a popular movement which not only protested
U.S. atrocities, but actually <i>engaged</i> themselves in the lives
of the victims&mdash;they took a much more courageous stand than was
ever done in the 1960s. I mean, the popular resistance that took
place in the Sixties was important&mdash;but there was nobody back
then who even <i>dreamt</i> of going to a Vietnamese village and
living there, because maybe a white face would limit the capacity of
the marauders to kill and destroy. That wasn&rsquo;t even an idea in
your head. In fact, nobody even went to try to <i>report</i> the war
from the side of the victims&mdash;that was unheard of. But in the
1980s it was common: plenty of people did it&mdash;in fact, people
who were coming out of religious groups like Witness for Peace were
doing that by the thousands and tens of thousands. And the people who
were doing that are serious left intellectuals, in my view.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">54</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember, what will
be <i>labeled</i> &ldquo;left&rdquo; in the general culture and given
publicity is going to be something that&rsquo;s ugly enough so that
people can be rallied to oppose it. So books are coming out now about
&ldquo;left intellectuals&rdquo; in France who were Stalinists&mdash;and
look at the awful things they did. Okay, <i>that</i> kind of &ldquo;left
intelligentsia&rdquo; is allowed to have publicity and prominence, in
fact the elite culture will give them as much prominence as it can.
Or people will say &ldquo;the left&rdquo; is things like the
Spartacist League, or the Socialist Workers Party or something&mdash;little
sectlets, the kinds of groups that anybody who&rsquo;s been involved
in movement activities knows are the people who hang around your
offices and your talks trying to see if they can disrupt things.
That&rsquo;s not the left, that&rsquo;s parasites that undermine the
left&mdash;but to show how lousy the left is, the elite press will
say &ldquo;Oh, the Spartacist League doesn&rsquo;t have a lot of
members&rdquo;: yeah, big excitement.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">55</font></sup>
On the other hand, the <i>real</i> left they don&rsquo;t talk
about&mdash;like they don&rsquo;t talk about the thousands and
thousands of people involved in this, that and the other cause doing
serious work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So if by &ldquo;left&rdquo;
you mean people who are struggling for peace, and justice, and
freedom, and human rights, and for social change, and elimination of
authority structures, whether in personal life or in the
institutions&mdash;if that&rsquo;s  what the left is, there are more
of them around than I can remember in my lifetime, at least. A lot
more.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: There really
has been a big change in the culture.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yes. If you take
almost any area you can think of in life, whether it&rsquo;s race, or
sex, or military intervention, the environment&mdash;these are all
things that didn&rsquo;t even <i>exist</i> in the 1950s, people
didn&rsquo;t even think they were issues, you just submitted. And
people don&rsquo;t anymore. I mean, if I just look at pictures from
the early Sixties, I can hardly believe how disciplined everything
was, how deep the authority structures were&mdash;even just in
personal relations, and in the way you looked and talked when you
went out with your friends. Younger people may not always realize it,
but life&rsquo;s a lot easier than it was forty years ago: there&rsquo;s
been a big change, there are a lot of successes to point to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, a lot of this
stuff got started over the Vietnam War. Well, in terms of official
ideology, all of us who were opposed to the war just lost, flat out:
within the mainstream institutions, the only question today is, have
the Vietnamese done enough to compensate us for the crimes that they
committed against us? That&rsquo;s the only question you&rsquo;re
allowed to discuss if you want to be a part of the educated culture
in the United States. So George Bush can get up and say, &ldquo;The
Vietnamese should understand that we bear them no permanent grudge,
we&rsquo;re not going to make them pay for everything they did to us;
if they finally come clean, you know, devote their entire lives and
every last resource they have to searching for the remains of one of
those people they viciously blew out of the sky, then maybe we&rsquo;ll
allow them entry into the civilized world&rdquo;&mdash;and there
won&rsquo;t be a single editorial writer or columnist who either
falls on the floor laughing, or else says, &ldquo;This guy is worse
than the Nazis.&rdquo; Because that&rsquo;s the way they all are: the
only issue is, will we forgive them for the crimes that they
committed against us?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">56</font></sup>
I mean, among the educated sector of the population in the U.S.,
there is overwhelming opposition to the war&mdash;but it&rsquo;s only
on what are called &ldquo;pragmatic&rdquo; grounds: namely, we
couldn&rsquo;t get away with it. So: &ldquo;We tried, we made
blundering efforts to do good, but it was a mistake.&rdquo; Well, at
that level, we&rsquo;ve just lost the entire discussion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
let&rsquo;s go to the general population: to this day, after
twenty-five years of this endless, unremitting propaganda to which no
response is ever tolerated, 66 percent of the American population
still disagrees with the elite culture&mdash;that tells you there&rsquo;s
been a victory at another level. I mean, if two-thirds of the
population still says in polls, after all of this brainwashing, that
the war was &ldquo;fundamentally wrong and immoral,&rdquo; not &ldquo;a
mistake,&rdquo; well, something got through. And remember, everybody
who&rsquo;s choosing that answer is choosing it all by
themselves&mdash;because that is not what they hear in the mainstream
culture, certainly not from educated people.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">57</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the thing we
have to keep in mind is, the people in power know it: they might not
want <i>us</i> to know it, but they know it. In fact, it&rsquo;s even
clear from their own documents that they know it. For example, a very
important early Bush administration planning document on Third World
intervention was leaked to the press and published on the day of the
ground attack in the Gulf War&mdash;by Maureen Dowd, incidentally,
who&rsquo;s basically a gossip columnist for the <i>New York Times.</i>
It was an inter-agency study on the general world situation, prepared
by the C.I.A. and the Pentagon and others during an early stage of
the Bush administration, well before the Gulf War. And it had a
section on U.S. military intervention, and what they said was: in the
case of confrontations with &ldquo;much weaker enemies&rdquo;&mdash;meaning
anybody we&rsquo;re willing to fight&mdash;we must not only defeat
them, but we must defeat them &ldquo;decisively and rapidly,&rdquo;
because anything else will &ldquo;undercut political support,&rdquo;
which is understood to be extremely thin.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">588</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, their belief
is, maybe we can frighten the domestic population and get them to
huddle under the flag for a couple days, but unless we get the
intervention over with quickly, it&rsquo;s hopeless&mdash;people are
going to start to rise up and pressure us to stop it. These people
recognize that there can&rsquo;t be classical interventions
anymore&mdash;you know, U.S. soldiers slogging it out in Vietnam for
years and years&mdash;it has to be either clandestine warfare, as in
Peru now, where not one American in ten thousand knows there are U.S.
troops, or the Panama/Iraq game, with enormous propaganda about the
enemy ready to destroy us, and then a quick victory without any
fighting.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">59</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
just a radical difference from the Kennedy period&mdash;and that
difference reflects major changes in the culture. Powerful people
here understand that they do not have the option of carrying out
foreign interventions anymore, unless they carry out decisive, rapid
victories over totally defenseless enemies, after having first gone
to great lengths to demonize them. They certainly recognize that&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s a tremendous victory for the left.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And anybody who&rsquo;s
my age or even a little bit younger must also realize that it&rsquo;s
a very different country today&mdash;and a much more civilized one.
Just look at the issue of the rights of indigenous peoples. When I
was a kid, I considered myself a radical-anarchist-this that and the
other thing&mdash;but I was playing &ldquo;Cowboys and Indians&rdquo;
with my friends: you know, shoot the Indians. That&rsquo;s like
playing &ldquo;Aryans and Jews&rdquo; in Germany&mdash;you go out and
try to kill the Jews. Well, that lasted for a very long time in the
United States, and nobody even noticed anything curious about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, just to tell
you another story: I live in Lexington, a mainly upper-middle-class
professional town near Boston, which is very liberal, everybody votes
for the Democrats, they all give to the right causes, and so on.
Well, in 1969&mdash;the year&rsquo;s interesting&mdash;one of my kids
was in fourth grade, and she had a Social Studies textbook about the
early history of New England, called <i>Exploring New England</i>;
the book was centered on a boy named Robert, who was being shown the
glories of colonial New England  by some older man or something.
Well, one day I decided to poke through it, because I was curious
about how the authors were going to deal with the colonists&rsquo;
extermination of the native peoples here. So I turned to the point in
the book where they got to the first really major act of genocide in
New England, the Pequot Massacre of 1637&mdash;when the colonists
murdered the Pequot tribe. And to my surprise, it was described quite
accurately: the colonists went into the village and slaughtered all
the men, women and children, burned everything down, burned out all
the Pequots&rsquo; crops. Then I got to the bottom line. The bottom
line had this boy, Robert, who&rsquo;s being told all of these
things, say: &ldquo;I wish I were a man and had been there.&rdquo; In
other words, it was a <i>positive</i> presentation. That was in 1969,
right after the My Lai massacre was exposed.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">60</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That would be
<i>inconceivable</i> today&mdash;because there have been very
important changes in the culture, and a real increase in
civilization. And those changes are largely the result of a lot of
very significant activism and organizing over the last couple
decades, by people that I would refer to as &ldquo;honest
intellectuals.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, I think all
of this screaming about &ldquo;Political Correctness&rdquo; that we
hear these days in the elite culture is basically just a tantrum over
the fact that it has been impossible to crush all of the dissidence
and the activism and the concern that&rsquo;s developed in the
general population in the last thirty years. I mean, it&rsquo;s not
that some of these &ldquo;P.C.&rdquo; things they point out aren&rsquo;t
true&mdash;yeah, sure, some of them are true. But the real problem is
that the huge right-wing effort to retake control of the ideological
system didn&rsquo;t work&mdash;and since their mentality is basically
totalitarian, any break in their control is considered a huge
tragedy: 98 percent control isn&rsquo;t enough, you have to have 100
percent control; these are totalitarian strains. But they couldn&rsquo;t
get it, especially among the general population. They have not been
able to beat back all of the gains of the popular movements since the
1960s, which simply led to a lot of concern about sexism, and racism,
and environmental issues, respect for other cultures, and all this
other bad stuff. And it&rsquo;s led to real hysteria among elites, so
you get this whole P.C. comedy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, right now
the universities are all flooded with Olin Professorships of Free
Enterprise [endowed by the conservative Olin Foundation], there are
glossy right-wing magazines handed out free to every student&mdash;and
these are not just right-wing, but <i>crazy</i> right-wing.
Meanwhile, everybody&rsquo;s screaming about how the left has taken
over. And that&rsquo;s all just out of hysteria that they haven&rsquo;t
gotten back total control&mdash;in fact, they&rsquo;ve probably lost
most of the population by now. And there&rsquo;s no reason to think
that those changes have ended&mdash;I think there&rsquo;s every
reason to think that they could go a lot further, and ultimately lead
to changes in the institutions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, people just
have to remember: there is nothing in the mainstream culture that is
ever going to tell you you&rsquo;ve succeeded&mdash;they&rsquo;re
always going to tell you you&rsquo;ve failed. I mean, the official
view of the Sixties is that  it was a bunch of crazies running around
burning down the universities and making noise, because they were
hysterics, or because they were afraid to go to Vietnam or
something&mdash;that&rsquo;s the official story, and that&rsquo;s
what people always hear from the intellectual culture. They may know
from their own lives and experience that that&rsquo;s not what really
happened, but they never hear anybody saying it: that&rsquo;s not the
message the system is always pouring into you through television, and
radio, and newspapers, and books, and histories, and so on and so
forth. It&rsquo;s beating into your head another story&mdash;that you
failed, and that you <i>should</i> have failed, because you were just
a bunch of crazies.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And of course, it&rsquo;s
natural that the official culture <i>would</i> take that view: it
does not want people to understand that you can make changes, that&rsquo;s
the last thing it wants people to understand. So if there have been
changes, it&rsquo;s because &ldquo;We the elites are so great that we
carried through the changes.&rdquo; When they bow to pressures,
they&rsquo;re going to present that as their benevolence. Like, &ldquo;We
ended slavery because we were such great moral figures that we
decided we didn&rsquo;t like slavery&rdquo;&mdash;but the cause is
gone, the slave revolts and the Abolitionist movement are gone.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And we&rsquo;ve seen
that on a not-so-trivial scale in the last thirty years with regard
to the Sixties movements. There&rsquo;s been something close to a
revolutionary change in moral values and cultural level in the
general population, but since that change has taken place without any
lasting institutional effects, the intellectual culture can just keep
pounding home its moral: &ldquo;You guys are worthless, you can&rsquo;t
do anything&mdash;why don&rsquo;t you just shut up and go home.&rdquo;
That&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re always going to tell us, and we
should try to remember that.</p>

New Forms of Oppression<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Dr. Chomsky,
some of your examples just reemphasize for me how power is not with
popular opinion. I&rsquo;m wondering, what do you think should happen
if power ever gets back into popular hands?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it wouldn&rsquo;t
be &ldquo;back,&rdquo; because it never was there. But I think what
we want to do is to extend the domains of popular power in as many
areas as possible. In fact, a large part of human history is just
that: a struggle to extend the domains of popular power and to break
down centers of concentrated power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Take the American
Revolution, for example. There was kind of an ideological structure
behind it, and that ideological structure was in part libertarian. So
if you really took the rhetoric seriously&mdash;and to some extent
the eighteenth-century Jeffersonians did, it wasn&rsquo;t
nothing&mdash;what you wanted to do was to break down concentrations
of power and to create a society of essentially equal participants.
Now of course, their sense of &ldquo;equal participants&rdquo;
included only a very small part of the population: white male
property-owners. Today we would call that a reversion to Nazism, and
rightly so. I mean, suppose some Third World country came out saying
that a part of the population is only three-fifths human&mdash;that&rsquo;s
in the U.S. Constitution, in fact.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">1</font></sup>
That would be unacceptable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the American
Constitution was basically for white male property-owners, because
they&rsquo;re the only ones who are real people&mdash;but the idea
was supposed to be that <i>they&rsquo;re</i> more or less equal, and
therefore you want to break down the concentrations of power that are
oppressing them. Well, in those days that meant Church power, state
power, the feudal system, and so on&mdash;and what you were supposed
to get was this egalitarian society for &ldquo;the People,&rdquo;
equals white male property-owners.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it didn&rsquo;t
work out that way, even for the white male property-owners, but that
was the picture behind it. And to some extent it was achieved&mdash;some
forms of centralized power <i>were</i> in fact dissolved. And the
course of American history since then has just gone on from there. In
the nineteenth century, concentrated power began to be located in
corporations&mdash;that&rsquo;s another center of power that now has
to be dissolved, and if you&rsquo;re an eighteenth-century-style
libertarian, that&rsquo;s what your main critique will be of today.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But it seems to me
that this is a process which goes on forever&mdash;it&rsquo;s not
something that you ever finish with. I mean, my own suspicion is that
with any victory that&rsquo;s won, we will then discover that there&rsquo;s
some other form of authority and repression we didn&rsquo;t even
notice before, and we&rsquo;ll try to go after that one.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And certainly there
is real progress you can point to. So while from the point of view of
Jeffersonian libertarians in the eighteenth century, there was no
deviation from democracy and freedom if rights were limited to white
male property-owners, nobody except some Neanderthal would accept
that view today. Well, that&rsquo;s progress, that&rsquo;s cultural
and social progress. And that progress was achieved through struggle:
it didn&rsquo;t happen because somebody sat around and talked about
it, it happened through the struggles of the Abolitionists, and the
women&rsquo;s movement, and the labor movement, and others.</p>

we need to do something to reverse the trend of revolutions falling
short throughout history&mdash;don&rsquo;t we have to change the
psychology of human beings before a really libertarian revolution
would succeed?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, we&rsquo;re
not going to change people&rsquo;s psychology&mdash;that&rsquo;s a
matter <i>for</i> revolution, that&rsquo;s not just going to happen.
But I don&rsquo;t think the failure of revolutions reflects so much
the psychology of human beings as it reflects the realities of power.
Now, in general I think it&rsquo;s true that popular revolutions
fail, and one or another elite grouping takes over afterwards. But
popular revolutions also succeed&mdash;we&rsquo;re no longer living
in the Middle Ages, after all.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Take something like
freedom of speech. That&rsquo;s a very important right, but it has
only very recently been achieved. Freedom of speech is an interesting
case, actually, where popular struggles over hundreds of years have
finally managed to expand a domain of freedom to the point where it&rsquo;s
pretty good, in fact&mdash;in the United States, the best in the
world. But it didn&rsquo;t just happen: it happened through the
struggles of the labor movement, and the Civil Rights Movement, and
the women&rsquo;s movement, and everything  else. It&rsquo;s the
popular movements which expanded the domain of freedom of speech
until it began to be meaningful&mdash;if those popular movements
hadn&rsquo;t taken place, we&rsquo;d still be where we were, say, in
1920, when there wasn&rsquo;t even a <i>theoretical</i> right of
freedom of speech. The history of this is remarkable; it&rsquo;s not
very well known.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Take the Supreme
Court: as many free speech cases came to the United States Supreme
Court from 1959 to 1974 as in the entire preceding history of the
Court&mdash;it was only <i>then</i> that freedom of speech was being
won.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">2</font></sup> I mean,
there had been important advances towards it through the struggles of
the labor movement, which had expanded it to include the rights of
picketing and labor organizing, but it wasn&rsquo;t until around the
late 1950s that the right of freedom of speech really began to be
claimed by popular movements&mdash;and because of that it found its
way into the courts, and the courts began passing decisions. It
wasn&rsquo;t until <i>1964</i> that the Supreme Court struck down the
1798 Sedition Act [which forbade spoken or written criticism of the
government, Congress, or the President]&mdash;that&rsquo;s very
recent history.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But were
there ever any prosecutions under the sedition laws?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Oh sure, plenty of
prosecutions.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">3</font></sup>
After the First World War, for example, Eugene Debs [Socialist Party
and labor leader] was put in jail for ten years for making a pacifist
speech; he was prosecuted under the 1917 Espionage Act, which was
another sedition law. That was a Presidential candidate&mdash;went to
jail for ten years for making a speech.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">4</font></sup>
Or take the Smith Act of 1940, for example: people went to jail under
the Smith Act. That made it illegal to join a group which
advocated&mdash;and didn&rsquo;t do anything about&mdash;changing the
social order.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">5</font></sup>
And all of these prosecutions were <i>upheld</i> by the Supreme
Court, remember: they were held to be consistent with the
Constitution. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">6</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, if you look
at some of the things that are called <i>victories</i> for freedom of
speech, you find that they weren&rsquo;t that at all. Take the famous
&ldquo;clear and present danger&rdquo; criterion to justify
repressing speech. That was from a decision by Holmes [Supreme Court
Justice] in 1919, one of Holmes&rsquo;s first big speech decisions&mdash;it
was <i>Schenck vs. United States</i>, for a long time considered one
of the big victories for civil liberties. Here&rsquo;s the case.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Schenck was a Jewish
socialist activist who put out a pamphlet in which he criticized the
draft as illegal. He gave constitutional arguments, and he urged
people to oppose the draft by legal means: try to oppose the draft in
the courts, that&rsquo;s what his pamphlet said&mdash;it probably
went out to twenty people or something. He was brought to court and
condemned for sedition: assaulting the state with words. It went up
to the Supreme Court, and this was just at the point when Holmes and
Brandeis were beginning to make a crack in the authoritarian
tradition. Holmes wrote the decision for a unanimous court, in which
he <i>upheld</i> the conviction&mdash;that&rsquo;s something that
people forget, he upheld Schenck&rsquo;s conviction&mdash;and he put
forth this &ldquo;clear and  present danger&rdquo; criterion: you can
be punished if you falsely cry &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; in a crowded
theater. Holmes said: you can control freedom of speech when there is
a clear and present danger, and when Schenck put out his document
saying people should oppose the draft by legal means, that was a
clear and present danger. <i>That&rsquo;s</i> the great victory for
civil liberties.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">7</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And so it goes. It
wasn&rsquo;t until 1964 that laws punishing seditious libel were
struck down. The case is interesting and instructive&mdash;it was a
Civil Rights Movement case, that&rsquo;s what did it; it was <i>New
York Times vs. Sullivan.</i> What happened was, the <i>New York Times</i>
was sued by the State of Alabama for running an ad in support of
Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement, which accused the
sheriff of Montgomery of doing a bunch of rotten things to civil
rights activists.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: This is the
big libel law case?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yes, but it was
<i>seditious</i> libel&mdash;because it was criticism of a government
official that was being punished. See, whether you have seditious
libel is sort of at the core of whether it&rsquo;s a free society or
not: if you&rsquo;re not allowed to criticize the government, if you
can be punished for assaulting the government with words, even if
that&rsquo;s in the background somewhere, the society is not really
free. And <i>truth</i> is no defense to this kind of libel charge,
keep in mind&mdash;in fact, traditionally truth makes the crime
worse, because if what you&rsquo;re saying is true, then the
undermining of state authority is even worse.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So this elected
sheriff in Alabama sued the <i>New York Times</i> saying they had
defamed him: the idea was that by publishing this ad, the <i>Times</i>
had undermined his authority as an agent of the state. Well, it went
up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court&mdash;I think it was
Brennan who wrote the opinion&mdash;for the first time said that
seditious libel is unacceptable. In fact, they referred to the 1798
Sedition Act, which had never been struck down by the Court, and said
this is inconsistent with the First Amendment.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">8</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s the first case in which the courts struck down seditious
libel.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you want a
history of this, the major Establishment legal history of freedom of
speech is a book by a legal scholar named Harry Kalven, called <i>A
Worthy Tradition.</i> The book&rsquo;s very good, except for the
title&mdash;it&rsquo;s actually an <i>unworthy</i> tradition that
he&rsquo;s describing. And he points out, I&rsquo;m basically quoting
him, that 1964 was the first time the United States met the minimal
condition for a democratic society: you can&rsquo;t assault the state
with words.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">9</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It wasn&rsquo;t
until 1969 that the Supreme Court then rejected the &ldquo;clear and
present danger&rdquo; test&mdash;which also is awful. &ldquo;Clear
and present danger&rdquo; shouldn&rsquo;t be a criterion for
punishing speech. The proper criterion, if there&rsquo;s any, should
be contribution to a crime&mdash;commission of, or maybe even
incitement to, an actual criminal act. That&rsquo;s a plausible
criterion. And the Supreme Court only reached <i>that</i> criterion
in 1969 [in the case <i>Brandenburg vs. Ohio</i>].<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">10</font></sup>
So you know, freedom of speech is a very recent innovation in the
United States&mdash;and the United States is unique: it doesn&rsquo;t
exist anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For example, you
might have read that in Canada they kept Salman Rushdie&rsquo;s book
[<i>The Satanic Verses</i>] out of the country for a couple weeks
while they were trying to figure out if it conflicted with a Canadian
law&mdash;it&rsquo;s referred to as an &ldquo;anti-hate&rdquo; law or
something. That law makes two things a crime. First, it makes it a
crime to distribute &ldquo;false news.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s something
that goes back to 1275, I looked it up&mdash;in 1275 the first &ldquo;false
news&rdquo; law was established in England, making it a crime to
produce &ldquo;false news.&rdquo; What that means is, the state
determines what&rsquo;s true, and if you say anything that&rsquo;s
not what the state says is true, that&rsquo;s &ldquo;false news&rdquo;
and you go to jail. That&rsquo;s in Canada. The second thing the law
prohibits is statements which are &ldquo;harmful to the public
interest.&rdquo; That provision was intended to stop people like
Holocaust deniers, guys who say there were no gas chambers and so on,
because they&rsquo;re harmful to the public interest&mdash;so
therefore the state can repress them. And when Canadian officials
stopped the Rushdie book, it was under that provision: they had to
check it out to see if it was inflaming hatred of Muslims or
something like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, everybody here
screamed about it at the time of the Rushdie case&mdash;but nobody
here raised a peep when that law was actually <i>applied</i> a few
years ago to put a guy in jail for fifteen months.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: In Canada?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In Toronto. This is
in fact the guy who the law was aimed at: he&rsquo;s some kind of
neo-Nazi who wrote a pamphlet, which he privately distributed, in
which he said that there were no gas chambers, or there was no
Holocaust, or one thing or another&mdash;and he was brought to court
under this very same law that kept the Rushdie book out. Ernst Zundel
his name is. He was convicted and sentenced by the courts to fifteen
months in prison plus a three-year period in which he is not
permitted to talk, publicly or privately, about anything directly or
indirectly related to the Holocaust&mdash;meaning he can&rsquo;t talk
with his friends about the Second World War. And there was a move to
deport him, which the Liberal Party in Canada supported.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">11</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, this was
reported in the American press. The <i>Boston Globe</i> had an
editorial in which they praised the jury for having the courage,
finally, to shut these guys up&mdash;by enforcing a law that gives
the state the power to determine truth, and to punish deviation from
it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">12</font></sup> When
the <i>Globe</i> started screaming about the Rushdie affair, I sent
the editors a copy of that editorial and asked them if they would
like to rethink it; well, I haven&rsquo;t heard anything yet. . . .
And you know, you didn&rsquo;t have Susan Sontag [American writer]
getting up in public and saying, &ldquo;I am Ernst Zundel,&rdquo; all
this kind of thing. The point is, you defend freedom of speech when
it&rsquo;s speech you like, and when you&rsquo;re sure there&rsquo;s
a half-billion Western Europeans out there between  you and the
Ayatollah Khomeini so you can be courageous [the Iranian leader put a
$6 million price on Rushdie&rsquo;s head in 1989]. But when you get
to a case where nobody likes what&rsquo;s being said, then somehow
defense of freedom of speech disappears.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you couldn&rsquo;t
have a law like that in the United States anymore, but you can have
it in Canada&mdash;and American intellectuals basically support it,
like the liberal <i>Boston Globe</i>, the <i>New York Times</i>, the
P.E.N. writers [an organization that promotes free expression for
writers] who don&rsquo;t get excited. It&rsquo;s only when it&rsquo;s
a case where we like the views being attacked that you get a big
outcry about freedom of speech here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And other countries
are the same as Canada&mdash;like in England, there is no freedom of
speech, by law. The police there can go into the B.B.C. [British
Broadcasting Corporation] offices, as they did recently, and rifle
through the files and take out anything they want, and the government
can prevent people from publishing things.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">13</font></sup>
In fact, as Alex Cockburn [British/ American journalist] just noted,
there&rsquo;s a new law in England called an &ldquo;anti-terrorism&rdquo;
law, which makes it illegal to report statements by people the state
regards as terrorists. Well, that includes Sinn F&eacute;in
representatives [Northern Irish political party], people who are
elected to Parliament in Britain&mdash;you&rsquo;re not allowed to
report what they say. Cockburn pointed out that this law was recently
used to block a documentary in which a couple of eighty-year-old
Irish women were being interviewed about things that happened in the
1930s: the television channels were afraid to run it because of the
risk of being prosecuted. So in England, you can&rsquo;t have a
couple of Irish women talking about things that went on in the 1930s,
because the state might not permit it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In France, where
there isn&rsquo;t even a vague tradition of freedom of speech, the
government last year canceled a newspaper of Algerian dissidents in
France on the sole ground that its publication was harmful to French
diplomatic relations with Algeria&mdash;none of the French
intellectuals even raised a peep; they were all screaming about
Salman Rushdie, but not about this.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">14</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, the same is
true wherever you go: the United States is unusual&mdash;possibly
even unique in the world&mdash;in that we actually protect freedom of
speech. But that was only won after long, bitter struggle&mdash;it
happened because people were fighting about it for centuries. And the
same is true of every other right you can think of.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8698_2032848809"></a>Negative
and Positive Freedoms<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: I have to
say that I&rsquo;m a little uncomfortable with your kind of extreme
freedom of speech advocacy, though. It just seems to me that until
there&rsquo;s a more equitable distribution of access to free speech,
it&rsquo;s going to be used destructively more often than it&rsquo;s
used positively. It makes me uncomfortable, so I just don&rsquo;t
want to jump on your bandwagon.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, let me see
what I can say to that. Freedoms are usually distinguished between
the &ldquo;negative&rdquo; kind and the &ldquo;positive&rdquo; kind.
&ldquo;Negative freedom&rdquo; means there&rsquo;s no coercive force
around that <i>prevents</i> you from doing something; &ldquo;positive
freedom&rdquo; is when circumstances are such that you can actually
<i>do it.</i> And those things can be quite different.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, freedom of
speech is available today in the United States mostly as a negative
freedom&mdash;meaning, nobody stops you. But it&rsquo;s not available
as a positive freedom, because as you say, access to the channels of
communication is highly skewed in our society, it&rsquo;s distributed
roughly in accordance with power, which obviously is highly unequal.
Okay, what&rsquo;s the way of overcoming that? One way of overcoming
it&mdash;which is, say, the Catharine MacKinnon [feminist legal
scholar] way&mdash;is to give the people in power even more power:
give the people in power even more power, so they can use it even
more inequitably. In other words, don&rsquo;t change the power
structure, just put through some laws prohibiting speech and let the
power structure enforce them. That means, give more power to the
people who have power, and let them use it the way they feel like
using it&mdash;that&rsquo;s exactly what it means. And they&rsquo;ll
stop the speech they want to stop. Alright, that&rsquo;s one way. The
other way is to try to change the distribution of power in the
society, but not to attack the freedom of speech.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">My own view is that
you should save the negative freedoms, defend strongly the negative
freedoms, but then try to make them positive freedoms. If the goal is
to achieve positive freedom, it doesn&rsquo;t help to destroy
negative freedom&mdash;like, giving the state the power to determine
what people can say does not improve the position of people who are
now powerless. And those are really the only choices you have.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, to attain
the negative freedom was a big achievement, I think. When the Supreme
Court struck down the Sedition Act, it didn&rsquo;t grant anybody
positive freedom, that&rsquo;s true. But it was a very important
victory for popular movements&mdash;because that kind of law strikes
right at the core of protest and dissidence. I don&rsquo;t think you
expand those victories by assigning more power to the state
authorities to control speech. And there is no other way to control
it: if speech is controlled, it&rsquo;s controlled by police power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN:
Acknowledging that, I still have two concerns. One is, don&rsquo;t we
have an obligation to the victims of free speech?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sure . . .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: The second
is, what about people who are saying speech that they know to be
false, but are hiding behind &ldquo;free speech&rdquo; to promulgate
their own interests?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
what they&rsquo;ll say about you. Look, ultimately the question is,
who gets to make that decision and enforce it? And there is only one
independent  structure that can do that, that&rsquo;s the state,
that&rsquo;s state power, government power, the police, you know, the
cops, F.B.I. <i>They</i> can make that decision, nobody else can. So
the question is, do you want them to be in a position to decide what
speech is acceptable? That&rsquo;s essentially what it comes down to.
And I would say, no, we don&rsquo;t want them to have any right to
make any decision about what anybody says. And of course, that&rsquo;s
going to mean that a lot of people are going to say things that you
think are rotten, and you&rsquo;re going to say things that a lot of
other people think are rotten.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As to the obligation
to the victims, sure&mdash;but that&rsquo;s a matter of building up
and extending the positive freedoms. In fact, here&rsquo;s a case
where I think the left is off on really marginal issues. Take the
question of pornography: I mean, undoubtedly women suffer from
pornography, but in terms of people suffering from speech in the
world, that&rsquo;s hardly even a speck. People suffer a lot more
from the teaching of free-trade economics in colleges&mdash;huge
numbers of people in the Third World are dying because of the stuff
that&rsquo;s taught in American economics departments, I&rsquo;m
talking about tens of millions. That&rsquo;s harm. Should we
therefore pass a law that says that the government ought to decide
what you teach in economics departments? Absolutely not, then it
would just get worse. They&rsquo;d force everybody to teach this
stuff.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What about
things like shouting &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; in a movie theater, or
commanding people to assault somebody? Don&rsquo;t you think there
should be a limit there?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the people who
attack free speech rights typically say, &ldquo;Look, speech is an
act&rdquo;&mdash;which is true, speech is an act. But therefore it
ought to be treated like other acts. I mean, let&rsquo;s agree,
speech is an act, it certainly is. But then let&rsquo;s treat it like
any other act. For example, if you throw a bomb into a crowded
theater, yeah, that&rsquo;s a crime, somebody ought to stop you. And
if you participate in the act of somebody else throwing one, even if
your participation is with words, somebody also ought to stop you.
Like, if you and I go into a grocery store with the intent to rob it,
and you have a gun, and I&rsquo;m your boss, and I say &ldquo;Fire!&rdquo;
and you kill the owner, that&rsquo;s speech. But it shouldn&rsquo;t
be <i>protected</i> speech, in my opinion&mdash;because that
statement is participation in a criminal act.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What about
things like sexual harassment?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s a
different story. See, there <i>are</i> conflicting rights. Rights
aren&rsquo;t an axiom system [i.e. where there are no
contradictions], and if you look closely at them, they often
conflict&mdash;so you just have to make judgments between them in
those cases. And like freedom of speech, another right that people
have is to work without getting harassed. So I think laws against
sexual harassment in the workplace are perfectly reasonable, because
they follow from a reasonable principle&mdash;namely, you should be
able to work without harassment, period. Sexual or any other kind. On
the other hand, sexual harassment in the streets is another story,
and I think it has to be treated differently.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, in the real
free speech discussions, there is nobody who&rsquo;s an absolutist on
free speech. People may pretend to be, but they&rsquo;re not. Like,
I&rsquo;ve never heard of anybody who says that you have a right to
come into my house and put up a Nazi poster on the wall. Well, okay,
blocking you from doing that is an infringement on your freedom of
speech, but it&rsquo;s also a protection of my right to privacy. And
those rights sometimes conflict, because rights do conflict, so
therefore we just have to make judgments between them&mdash;and those
judgments are often not easy to make. But in general, I think we
should be extremely wary about placing the power to make those
determinations in the hands of authorities, who are going to respond
to the distribution of power in the society as they carry them out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: In my
university, we had an architecture professor who in the course of his
class was telling people that if they wanted to buy a camera they
should bring a Jew with them, all sorts of racist things like that.
People were wondering if they should censor him or not.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, it&rsquo;s a
hard question. For instance, I was an undergraduate right after the
Second World War, and I happened to have a German class taught by a
guy who was a flat outright Nazi&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t even hide it.
There were a lot of war veterans around in those days, so guys were
ready to kill him and stuff, because these things were very live in
people&rsquo;s minds. But should the university have fired him? I
didn&rsquo;t think so. I think it&rsquo;s dangerous to impose such
constraints on what people are allowed to say. There are other ways
of dealing with it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You might
say that someone else in the classroom has a right not to hear it,
though.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yes, but see, if a
student gets up and denounces him, the student has a right to do
that, and then if the student is punished you&rsquo;ve got a straight
case&mdash;because the guy in authority has no right to do anything
except sit and listen. But should you stop the teacher from talking
about things? I think that&rsquo;s tricky.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Even there, though,
it&rsquo;s not totally straightforward. Like, there&rsquo;s a
contractual arrangement when you go to a class: namely, you want to
study chemistry or whatever it is, that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re
there, and if the teacher starts talking about fundamentalist
religion or something, you have a right to say, &ldquo;He shouldn&rsquo;t
be paid, get rid of him, because I came here to study chemistry, that
was our common agreement, and he violated that agreement&mdash;so
throw him out.&rdquo; On the other hand, if the teacher just says
things you don&rsquo;t like, that&rsquo;s different.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, rights aren&rsquo;t
an axiom system, so there are conflicts between them, and people just
have to make their own judgments. But my own judgment, at least,
tends to be that a lot of leeway ought to be allowed. Often the cases
are quite hard, though&mdash;because our moral codes simply aren&rsquo;t
clear enough to give answers in a lot of situations, and people come
up with different ones.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You think
there&rsquo;s some ambiguity with sexual harassment, then?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Oh yeah, a fair
amount of ambiguity. For example, sexual harassment by words in the
streets&mdash;like if somebody makes a nasty crack about some woman&rsquo;s
dress or something&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think they should be put in
jail.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: What about
violence on television? Does that also conflict with other rights?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Violence on
television raises quite hard questions, I think. But I don&rsquo;t
know: if you look at the literature on whether T.V. violence or
pornography cause a demonstrable harm&mdash;you know, result in
violence in the real world&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t show anything
convincing. So maybe it&rsquo;s too hard to study or something like
that, but there are almost no probative results that I know of one
way or the other: the facts just aren&rsquo;t there. There&rsquo;s
<i>psychic</i> harm, that&rsquo;s undoubtedly true, but that you
can&rsquo;t measure. As for the kinds of things you can measure, like
increase in acts of violence&mdash;I mean, you probably get more acts
of violence coming after things like sports events; not huge amounts
more, but there&rsquo;s a notable increase in domestic violence, say,
after things like the Superbowl.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">15</font></sup></p>

and Activism<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Mr.
Chomsky, on a very different note, I&rsquo;d like to talk a bit about
some of the recent computer technologies like the Internet, and
e-mail, and the World Wide Web and so on, and how significant an
impact you think they are going to have on political activism and
organizing in the future. Do you see the Internet as more of a force
for democracy, or a force for diverting the population from engaging
themselves politically in the world?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, my feeling is
that the Internet is pretty much the same sort of phenomenon as radio
and television were&mdash;or for that matter, as automation. Look, in
most cases technology isn&rsquo;t predisposed to help people or harm
people&mdash;there&rsquo;s very rarely anything inherent in it which
requires that either of those things be the case, it just depends on
who gets control of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So take radio, for
example. You might ask why popular movements in the United States
have to look to small community-controlled radio stations to get
programming which addresses their interests and needs and goals, why
doesn&rsquo;t any mainstream radio do that? Well, the reason is, the
United States just diverged from the rest of the world on this back
around the late 1920s and early Thirties, when radio was first coming
into existence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, radio has a
limited frequency band, which necessarily has to be rationed&mdash;so
the question is, how is that rationing going to be done? Well, in
every major country in the world&mdash;and maybe in <i>every</i>
country except the United States&mdash;radio was turned into a public
forum to some degree, meaning it&rsquo;s as democratic as the country
is. Like, in Russia, it&rsquo;s not democratic, in Great Britain,
it&rsquo;s as democratic as England is&mdash;but somehow it&rsquo;s
still in the public domain. The United States went the other way:
here radio was privatized, it was put into private hands&mdash;and
furthermore, that was called a <i>victory</i> for democracy here.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">16</font></sup>
So now if you want radio that&rsquo;s not under corporate control in
the United States, you have to go to small local community radio
stations&mdash;which are very important, but of course are on the
margins, and have only extremely limited resources.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take television:
when television came along in the 1940s, the same thing happened in
the United States. In fact, in the case of television, there wasn&rsquo;t
even a battle about it&mdash;it was just completely handed over to
private power at once. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">17</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I think the
Internet is going to be the same basic story: if it&rsquo;s put in
the hands of private power, like T.V. and radio were, then we know
exactly how it&rsquo;s going to turn out. In fact, they&rsquo;ve been
telling us about it constantly. So I remember an article in the <i>Wall
Street Journal</i> about the wonders of all the new technology, and
they described the great things that can be done because it&rsquo;s
&ldquo;interactive&rdquo;&mdash;you know, you don&rsquo;t just have
to be passive anymore, now you can really <i>do</i> things when
you&rsquo;re sitting there in front of the tube. Well, they described
how it would work, and they gave two examples, one for women and the
other for men.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For women, it&rsquo;s
going to be an incredible home-shopping thing: like, you&rsquo;re
sitting there watching some model, and she shows you some ridiculous
object, and you figure, &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d better have that or my
kid won&rsquo;t grow up properly&rdquo;&mdash;and now it&rsquo;s
<i>interactive</i>, you know, so you can just push a button and
they&rsquo;ll send it right over to your house. That&rsquo;s the
interaction for women. For men, the example they gave was of watching
the Superbowl, which every red-blooded male is supposed to do. Well,
today it&rsquo;s passive: you just sit there and watch the gladiators
fighting. But with the new technology, it&rsquo;s going to be
<i>interactive.</i> So what they suggest is, while the team&rsquo;s
in its huddle getting instructions from the coach about the next
play, everyone in the audience&mdash;you know, the entire male
population  that&rsquo;s alive&mdash;is going to be asked to make
their own decision about it: like, should it be a pass, or a run, or
a kick or something. And then after the play is run (which is going
on completely independently of this, of course) they&rsquo;ll flash
on the screen what people thought the coach should have done&mdash;that&rsquo;s
going to be the interaction for men.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And that&rsquo;s
probably the way it&rsquo;s going to go in general: it&rsquo;ll be
used as another technique for control and manipulation, and for
keeping people in their roles as mindless consumers of things they
don&rsquo;t really want. Sure&mdash;why should the people who own the
society do things any differently?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But of course, none
of these technologies <i>have</i> to be used like that&mdash;again,
it just depends who ends up controlling them. I mean, if the general
public ever ended up controlling them, they could be used quite
differently. For example, these information-processing systems could
be used as methods by which working people could come to control
their own workplaces without the need for managers and bosses&mdash;so
every person in the workplace could have all the information they
need in order to make all the decisions themselves, in real time,
when it counts. Well, in that kind of circumstance, the same
technology would be a highly democratizing device&mdash;in fact, it
would help eliminate the core of the whole system of authority and
domination. But obviously it&rsquo;s not just going to develop like
that on its own&mdash;people will have to organize and fight to make
that sort of thing ever happen, in fact fight very strenuously for
it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As to the effects of
all of this on activism, I think it&rsquo;s a complicated story. I
think we can be certain that there&rsquo;s a lot of thinking going on
about whether to even allow things like the Internet to exist&mdash;because
from the point of view of power, it&rsquo;s just too democratic: it&rsquo;s
very hard to control what&rsquo;s in it, and who can gain access to
it. For example, I have a daughter living in Nicaragua, and during
the U.S. contra war in the 1980s it was impossible to telephone or
send letters there. The only way I could stay in contact with her was
through the ARPAnet, which is basically a Pentagon computer system I
was able to get access to through M.I.T.&mdash;so we were
corresponding thanks to the Pentagon. Well, that&rsquo;s the kind of
thing that happens on the Internet, and a lot of powerful people
obviously don&rsquo;t like that aspect of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And they don&rsquo;t
like the fact that you can get the text of the G.A.T.T. [General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] treaty, and the latest news that
doesn&rsquo;t appear in the U.S. newspapers, and so on&mdash;in fact,
if you look around on the Internet, you can find virtually everything
I talk about somewhere in there. And on some issues, like say, East
Timor, it&rsquo;s also been an invaluable political organizing
tool&mdash;because most of the information about what happened there
was simply silenced by the U.S. press for years and years. Well,
those are all bad things from the perspective of private power, and
they surely would like to stop that side of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
it has a number of other advantages for power. For one thing, it
diverts people, it atomizes people. When you&rsquo;re sitting in
front  of your tube, you&rsquo;re alone. I mean, there&rsquo;s
something about human beings that just makes face-to-face contact
very different from banging around on a computer terminal and getting
some noise coming back&mdash;that&rsquo;s very impersonal, and it
breaks down human relations. Well, that&rsquo;s obviously a good
result from the point of view of people with power&mdash;because it&rsquo;s
extremely important to drive human sentiments out of people if you
just want them to be passive and obedient and under control. So if
you can eliminate things like face-to-face contact and direct
interaction, and just turn people into what&rsquo;s caricatured as
kind of an M.I.T. nerd&mdash;you know, somebody who&rsquo;s got
antennae coming out of his head, and is wired into his computer all
the time&mdash;that&rsquo;s a real advantage, because then you&rsquo;ve
made them more inhuman, and therefore more controllable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another thing I&rsquo;ve
found is that there&rsquo;s a kind of degraded character to e-mail
messages. People are just too casual about them&mdash;they send you
any half-baked idea they haven&rsquo;t even thought through yet,
whenever the impulse hits them. And the result is, it ends up being a
tremendous burden even to <i>read</i> everything that comes across,
let alone to answer it&mdash;so that can easily end up being all you
do with your time. And people do put <i>huge</i> numbers of hours
into it. In fact, there are friends of mine whose quality of work I
think is seriously declining, because of their overwhelming
involvement in e-mail interactions. It&rsquo;s extremely seductive
just to sit at the computer screen and bang at it all day.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Furthermore, I think
there are still other aspects to it which are very threatening to
popular movements. For instance, one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed is that
a lot of activists have been dropping subscriptions to left journals
recently. Why? Because they can get them through the Internet. Now,
see, if I was in the C.I.A. or something, right now I&rsquo;d be
saying, &ldquo;Look, let&rsquo;s encourage this&mdash;it&rsquo;s true
it has the negative effect of allowing people to get more
information, but it also has the positive effect of destroying
alternative institutions. So let&rsquo;s let it go on&mdash;because
when all these people stop paying their subscriptions to, I don&rsquo;t
know, <i>Z Magazine</i> or something, that is going to destroy those
institutions, and that&rsquo;s going to separate and fragment the
left even more, and maybe even destroy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I doubt that
anybody in the C.I.A. has this much brains, but if they had enough
brains, I think they would just want the whole thing to go on,
because it&rsquo;s probably going to destroy the dissident
organizations&mdash;and it&rsquo;ll destroy them because we&rsquo;re
so anti-social that we don&rsquo;t even see the <i>point</i> of
supporting popular institutions. Remember, even if you&rsquo;re an
activist on the left, what you&rsquo;ve constantly been taught from
childhood, and what you&rsquo;ve still got ingrained in your head is:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just out for myself, and therefore if I can get the
information for nothing, why should I help to build an institution?&rdquo;
Well, that&rsquo;s obviously a very anti-social attitude&mdash;but
you find it&rsquo;s very hard to break out of: we&rsquo;ve just got
it. So there are a number of aspects to these technologies that are
highly dangerous, in my view&mdash;and I hope people will soon start
to recognize and resist those aspects of them.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8702_2032848809"></a>&ldquo;Free
Trade&rdquo; Agreements<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You
mentioned that people with power probably don&rsquo;t like it that
the G.A.T.T. treaty got onto the Internet. It just emphasized for me
how these international trade agreements are being forced on us, and
yet nobody even knows what they&rsquo;re about. I&rsquo;m wondering
what you think of that?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, plenty of
people know what they&rsquo;re about&mdash;there are plenty of people
working for big corporations who know what the G.A.T.T. treaty is
about, for example. But you&rsquo;re right, the general population
here doesn&rsquo;t have the slightest idea about it&mdash;I mean,
overwhelmingly the general population of the United States hasn&rsquo;t
even <i>heard</i> of G.A.T.T., and certainly they don&rsquo;t know
what its likely effects are going to be. [G.A.T.T. was first
established in 1947, but the &ldquo;Uruguay Round&rdquo; of
negotiations to modify it concluded in December 1993; the treaty then
was signed in April 1994.]</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What do I think of
that? I think it&rsquo;s ridiculous&mdash;grotesque, in fact. Look,
G.A.T.T. is something of major significance. The idea that it&rsquo;s
going to be rammed through Congress on a fast track without public
discussion just shows that anything resembling democracy in the
United States has completely collapsed. So whatever one thinks about
G.A.T.T., at least it should be a topic for the general public to
become informed about, and to investigate, and to look at, and think
about carefully. That much is easy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you ask what
should <i>happen</i> in that public discussion&mdash;well, if that
public discussion ever comes along, I&rsquo;ll be glad to say what I
think. And what I think is in fact mixed. It&rsquo;s like N.A.F.T.A.:
I don&rsquo;t know of anyone who was opposed to a North American
trade agreement in principle&mdash;the question was, <i>what kind</i>?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">18</font></sup>
So before N.A.F.T.A. got passed [in 1993], mainstream groups like the
Congressional Office of Technology Assessment&mdash;can&rsquo;t get
more centrist than that&mdash;came out with very sharp and
intelligent critiques of the Executive version of N.A.F.T.A., the one
that finally went through. And they pointed out that in fact
N.A.F.T.A. was designed to be an <i>investor rights</i> agreement,
not a &ldquo;free trade&rdquo; agreement&mdash;and that it was going
to drive the economies of each of the three participating countries
[the U.S., Canada and Mexico] down towards a kind of low-wage,
low-growth equilibrium; they didn&rsquo;t say it of course, but it&rsquo;ll
also be a <i>high-profit</i> equilibrium. And they suggested very
constructive alternatives. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">19</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, those sorts of
constructive critiques never even entered the mainstream discussion
about N.A.F.T.A. here: all you ever heard in the media was, &ldquo;Crazy
jingoists don&rsquo;t like Mexican workers.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The same was true of
the American labor movement: its proposals were nothing like what was
constantly being denounced in the press with virtually 100 percent
uniformity.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">20</font></sup>
The Labor Advisory Committee, for example&mdash;which  by law is
required to give its opinion on these things, but was illegally cut
out of the discussion&mdash;came out with quite a constructive report
on N.A.F.T.A.: it wasn&rsquo;t against <i>an</i> agreement, it was
against <i>that</i> agreement. In fact, the story of the Labor
Advisory Committee report tells you a lot about the way that
N.A.F.T.A. was passed in the U.S., a lot about American democracy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Twenty years ago,
Congress enacted a Trade Act requiring that before any trade-related
legislation or treaty is passed, there has to be consultation with a
&ldquo;Labor Advisory Committee&rdquo; they set up which is based in
the unions, such as they are. That&rsquo;s by law: the Labor Advisory
Committee has to give an analysis and a critique of any American
trade-related issue, so obviously that would include N.A.F.T.A.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">21</font></sup>
Well, the Labor Advisory Committee was informed by the Clinton White
House that their report was due on September 9th; they were not given
an inkling of what was in the treaty until September <i>8th</i>&mdash;so
obviously they couldn&rsquo;t even convene to meet. Then on top of
that, they weren&rsquo;t even given the whole text of the treaty&mdash;it&rsquo;s
this huge treaty, hundreds and hundreds of pages.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But somehow they did
manage to write a response to it anyway, and it was a very angry
response&mdash;both because of the utter contempt for democracy
revealed by these maneuvers, but also because from the glimmerings of
what they could get out of N.A.F.T.A. when they sort of flipped
through it for a couple of hours, it was obvious that this thing was
just going to have a <i>devastating</i> effect on American labor, and
probably also a devastating effect on Mexican labor too, though of
course it will be highly beneficial to American investors, and
probably also to Mexican investors.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">22</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s also certain to have a highly destructive effect on the
environment&mdash;because its laws supersede federal and state
legislation. So obviously there are really major issues here,
crucially important issues, which in a functioning democracy would
have been the subject of intensive public consideration and debate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, if you
looked closely, even N.A.F.T.A.&rsquo;s <i>advocates</i> conceded
that it was probably going to harm the majority of the populations of
the three countries. For instance, its advocates in the United States
were saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really good, it&rsquo;ll only harm
semi-skilled workers&rdquo;&mdash;footnote: 70 percent of the
workforce.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">23</font></sup>
As a matter of fact, after N.A.F.T.A. was safely passed, the <i>New
York Times</i> did their first analysis of its predicted effects in
the New York region: it was a very upbeat article talking about how
terrific it was going to be for corporate lawyers and P.R. firms and
so on. And then there was a footnote there as well. It said, well,
<i>everyone</i> can&rsquo;t gain, there&rsquo;ll also be some losers:
&ldquo;women, blacks, Hispanics, and semi-skilled labor&rdquo;&mdash;in
other words, most of the people of New York.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">24</font></sup>
But you can&rsquo;t have everything. And those were the <i>advocates.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, it&rsquo;s
kind of striking that about a day or two after N.A.F.T.A. was passed,
the Senate approved the most onerous crime bill in U.S. history [the
Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act], which the House then
made even worse. Now, I don&rsquo;t know if that was just a symbolic
coincidence or what&mdash;but it makes sense. I mean, N.A.F.T.A. was
clearly going to have the effect of reducing wages for probably
three-quarters of the American population, and it&rsquo;s going to
make a lot more of the population superfluous from the point of view
of profits&mdash;so the Crime Bill just will take care of a lot of
them, by throwing them in jail.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, that&rsquo;s
N.A.F.T.A.&mdash;what about G.A.T.T.? Well, in India, for example,
there were hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in the
streets about some of the G.A.T.T. provisions&mdash;which <i>they</i>
know about. I mean, we may be very ignorant about it in the United
States, but people in the Third World know a lot about G.A.T.T.:
Indian peasants understand what&rsquo;s being done to them, even if
people here don&rsquo;t, which is why G.A.T.T. has to be passed
virtually at gunpoint in countries like India.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">25</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, what are those
people so upset about? Here&rsquo;s one thing. One of the protections
codified in the current G.A.T.T. agreements, as in N.A.F.T.A., is
what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;intellectual property rights&rdquo; [i.e.
rights to registered trademarks, patented technologies, and
copyrights of valuable &ldquo;information&rdquo; products ranging
from music to genes]. Intellectual property rights are a
protectionist measure, they have nothing to do with free trade&mdash;in
fact, they&rsquo;re the exact <i>opposite</i> of free trade. And
they&rsquo;ll do a lot of things, but two really crucial ones.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First of all,
they&rsquo;re going to increase the duration of patents: meaning, if
Merck Pharmaceutical patents some drug, thanks to publicly-subsidized
work in American universities, for example, now they can get a much
longer patent for it under G.A.T.T.&mdash;much longer than any of the
rich countries ever accepted during the periods when <i>they</i> were
developing, incidentally. In fact, it&rsquo;s only in very recent
years that the rich countries have even honored patent rights at
all&mdash;the United States never did when it was a developing
country, for instance. So, point one: patents are being much
extended.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Secondly, the <i>nature</i>
of patents is being shifted in character. See, up until now, patents
have been what are called &ldquo;process patents&rdquo;&mdash;in
other words, if Merck figures out a way to create a drug, the <i>process</i>
of making the drug is patented, but not the drug itself. The G.A.T.T.
treaty, like N.A.F.T.A., shifts that: now it&rsquo;s the <i>product</i>
that&rsquo;s patented&mdash;meaning the Indian or Argentine
pharmaceutical industries no longer can try to figure out a smarter
way to produce the same drug at half the cost, in order to get it to
their own populations more affordably. Notice that these are not only
highly protectionist measures, but they&rsquo;re a blow <i>against</i>
economic efficiency and technological progress&mdash;that just shows
you how much &ldquo;free trade&rdquo; really is involved in all of
this.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, there are
significant historical precedents on product patents, and I&rsquo;m
sure that they are perfectly well known to the G.A.T.T. designers.
France, for example, once had a chemical industry, but it lost
it&mdash;most of the French chemical industry moved to Switzerland,
which is why Switzerland now has such a large chemical industry. The
reason? France happened  to have product patents, which were such a
barrier to innovation and technical progress that the French chemical
companies just decided to go elsewhere. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">26</font></sup>
Well, now G.A.T.T. is trying to impose that inefficiency on the
entire world. In fact, India already has been forced to accept it: a
little while ago they did what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;liberalizing&rdquo;
their pharmaceuticals industry, meaning they opened it up to foreign
penetration. So now drug prices will shoot sky-high, more children
will die, people won&rsquo;t be able to afford medications they need,
and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">27</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, these changes
in patents are just one part of G.A.T.T.: they&rsquo;re one piece of
a whole attempt that is now being made to ensure that unaccountable
transnational corporations will monopolize the technologies of the
future. In my opinion, that&rsquo;s grotesque&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see
any reason to push <i>that</i> through. Certainly anyone who believes
in free trade would be opposed to these policies: they&rsquo;re a
high level of protectionism, which in fact is specifically designed
to be contrary to even the narrow definitions of economic efficiency
they teach you in the University of Chicago Economics Department
[home of well-known exponents of free-market theory]. G.A.T.T. is
going to cut down on technological innovation, it&rsquo;s going to
cut down on economic efficiency&mdash;but by some strange accident,
it&rsquo;ll also happen to increase profits, so of course nobody will
pick up on any of the contradictions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As a matter of fact,
it&rsquo;s not even clear that these so-called &ldquo;free trade&rdquo;
agreements are going to increase <i>trade</i> at all, in any
authentic sense. So there&rsquo;s a lot of talk in the papers these
days about the growth of international trade, which is supposed to
show everyone how wonderful the market is. But if you take a look at
that international trade, you&rsquo;ll find that it&rsquo;s a very
curious kind of growth: about 50 percent of U.S. trade now is
<i>internal</i> to corporations, which means it&rsquo;s about as much
&ldquo;trade&rdquo; as if you move something from one shelf of a
grocery store to another, it just happens to cross an international
border, so therefore it gets recorded as &ldquo;trade.&rdquo; And the
figures are comparable for other major countries. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">28</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That means, for
example, that if the Ford Motor Company sends some parts to Mexico to
be assembled by super-cheap labor under essentially no environmental
regulations and then they ship it back up to the United States to add
more value to it, that&rsquo;s &ldquo;trade.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s
not trade at all: those aren&rsquo;t exports, they didn&rsquo;t even
enter the Mexican market&mdash;they&rsquo;re centrally-managed
interactions by huge institutions, with a very &ldquo;visible hand&rdquo;
pushing them around, and with all kinds of other market distortions
involved that nobody here bothers to study very much but which
undoubtedly are severe. And 50 percent is not a small amount&mdash;that&rsquo;s
a lot. I mean, at the time that N.A.F.T.A. was passed, there was a
lot of talk in the press about U.S. trade with Mexico soaring&mdash;but
there wasn&rsquo;t talk about the fact that more than half of U.S.
exports to Mexico were <i>internal</i> to corporations. So in fact,
N.A.F.T.A. and G.A.T.T. might really end up <i>reducing</i>
trade&mdash;they&rsquo;ll probably increase things moving across
borders, but that&rsquo;s not the same as trade: those transfers are
not market interactions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, okay, these
are complicated matters, and you don&rsquo;t just want to sloganize
about them&mdash;but in my opinion, all of these international
agreements are part of a general attack on democracy and free markets
that we&rsquo;re seeing in the contemporary period, as banks,
investment firms, and transnational corporations develop new methods
to extend their power free from public scrutiny. And in that context,
it&rsquo;s not very surprising that they&rsquo;re all being rammed
through as quickly and secretly as they are. And whatever you happen
to think about the specific treaties that have now been put into
place, there is just no doubt that their consequences for most of the
people in the world are going to be vast.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, these
treaties are just one more step in the process that&rsquo;s been
accelerating in recent years of differentiating the two main class
interests of the world still further&mdash;far more so than before&mdash;so
that the Third World wealth-distribution model is being extended
everywhere. And while the proportions of wealth in a rich country
like the United States will always differ significantly from the
proportions in a deeply impoverished country like Brazil, for example
(deeply impoverished thanks to the fact that it&rsquo;s been under
the Western heel for centuries), you can certainly see the effects
under way in recent years. I mean, in the United States things
probably aren&rsquo;t going to get to the point where 80 percent of
the population is living like Central Africa and 10 percent is
fabulously wealthy. Maybe it&rsquo;ll be 50 percent and 30 percent or
something like that, with the rest somewhere in between&mdash;because
more people are always going to be needed in the Western societies
for things like scientific research and skilled labor, providing
propaganda services, being managers, things like that. But the
changes no doubt are happening, and they will be rapidly accelerated
as these accords are implemented.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8704_2032848809"></a>Defense
Department Funding and &ldquo;Clean Money&rdquo;<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, just
to go back to freedom of thought for a second&mdash;I&rsquo;m curious
what your feeling is about the Defense Department funding so many of
our scientists today. Do you see that as a problem in terms of
freedom of research and freedom of inquiry? And does it make you feel
at all uncomfortable personally to be working at M.I.T.?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To tell you the
honest truth, I&rsquo;ve always thought that&rsquo;s kind of a
secondary issue. For instance, in the late 1960s, M.I.T. was about 80
percent funded by the Defense Department&mdash;it&rsquo;s less than
that today, because of things like cancer research money. But what
did that mean? Was M.I.T. different from, say, Harvard, which wasn&rsquo;t
so much funded by the Defense Department? Well, about the only major
differences between them were that M.I.T. was a little bit more open
to radical ideas, and there was more political activism and fewer
ideological controls. That&rsquo;s about it, as far as I could see.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, there was once
a time when I was being funded by the Air Force myself&mdash;to do
exactly the same sort of thing that I&rsquo;m doing now in my
scientific work. Right now I&rsquo;m not, so if you asked me whether
I&rsquo;m funded by the Defense Department, I could in some narrow
sense say no. But the fact of the matter is, I <i>am</i> funded by
the Defense Department, whether I have a contract with them or
not&mdash;because if the Defense Department weren&rsquo;t funding the
Electrical Engineering Department, which M.I.T. needs, the Institute
would not be able to fund my department. I mean, if you&rsquo;re
teaching <i>music</i> at M.I.T. you&rsquo;re being funded by the
Defense Department, because if somebody they really cared about
<i>weren&rsquo;t</i> being funded by the Defense Department, they
wouldn&rsquo;t have anything left to pay you to teach music. So in
part the thing is kind of like a bookkeeping device.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As for its influence
on what&rsquo;s done, that&rsquo;s very small: the Defense Department
doesn&rsquo;t give a damn what you do most of the time&mdash;they
just want to fund it, because they want to have a bigger bureaucracy
or something like that. So there&rsquo;s very little reporting back
by the scientists, they don&rsquo;t pay much attention to you, they
don&rsquo;t care whether you did what you said you&rsquo;d do or
something else, and so on. In fact, back in the Sixties, there was a
guy in my lab who was working on translating Humboldt [a Prussian
philosopher]&mdash;he was being funded by the Office of Naval
Research, they didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As far as the moral
issue goes&mdash;I mean, it&rsquo;s not as if there&rsquo;s some
clean money somewhere. If you&rsquo;re in a university, you&rsquo;re
on dirty money&mdash;you&rsquo;re on money which is coming from
people who are working somewhere, and whose money is being taken
away, and is going to support things like universities. Now, there
are a lot of ways in which that money can be taken away from those
working people and get fed into the universities. One way is by
diverting it through taxes and government bureaucracies. Another way
is by channeling it through profits&mdash;like, some rich benefactor
gives it as a gift to the university, meaning he stole it from his
workers. And there are all sorts of other ways in which it happens
too. But it all comes down to the same point: if you&rsquo;re at a
university, you&rsquo;re there because there is a social structure
which commits a certain amount of &ldquo;surplus product,&rdquo; if
you want to use a Marxist term, to funding people sitting around in
universities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, I don&rsquo;t
see a whole lot of difference myself as to whether that money works
its way through the Department of Defense or through some other
mechanism&mdash;that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve never made a big fuss
about this. I mean, to the extent that the Defense Department
influenced what scientists <i>do</i>, it would matter. But good
universities don&rsquo;t permit that, by and large&mdash;they don&rsquo;t
permit it just for their own internal reasons: if you started
permitting that, you&rsquo;d lose the ability to <i>do</i> science
altogether. Science simply can&rsquo;t be done under those kinds of
ideological constraints.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s sort of
like what happens in cancer research: Congress is funding a lot of
cellular biology because they want somebody to discover a cure for
cancer by the time they get it, but what the scientists are doing is
just what they know how to do&mdash;and what they know how to do has
nothing to do  with cancer, what they know how to do is work with big
molecules. Maybe a cure for cancer will come out of it someday, but
that&rsquo;s sort of by the side. And that&rsquo;s pretty much the
way it goes in the sciences: you can work on what you understand, you
can&rsquo;t work on what people tell you to solve. It&rsquo;s like
the joke about the drunk and the streetlight: you see some drunk guy
looking for something under the streetlight and you go over to him
and ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;I
lost my key.&rdquo; You say, &ldquo;Where did you lose it?&rdquo; He
says, &ldquo;On the other side of the street.&rdquo; You say, &ldquo;So
why are you looking over here?&rdquo; &ldquo;Well, this is where the
light is.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the way the sciences work: you look
where the light is&mdash;because that&rsquo;s all you can do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You understand only
a certain small number of things, and you just have to work around
the periphery of them. If somebody says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
have you solve this problem out here,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
gladly take your money&rdquo;&mdash;and then you go on looking where
you are. And there basically is nothing much else that can be done.
If you started trying to direct the money to solving those problems,
you&rsquo;d just do nothing, because we don&rsquo;t know how to solve
them. There&rsquo;s kind of a tacit compact between funders and
recipients to overlook this . . .</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8706_2032848809"></a>The
Favored State and Enemy States<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam,
people often attack you as a political commentator for focusing your
criticism against the activities of the United States, and not so
much against the old Soviet Union, or Vietnam, or Cuba and so on&mdash;the
official enemies. I&rsquo;d like to know what you think about that
kind of criticism?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it&rsquo;s
true that&rsquo;s one of the standard things I get&mdash;but see, if
that criticism is meant honestly (and most of the time it&rsquo;s
not), then it&rsquo;s really missing the crucial point, I think. See,
I focus my efforts against the terror and violence of my own state
for really two main reasons. First of all, in my case the actions of
my state happen to make up the main component of international
violence in the world. But much more importantly than that, it&rsquo;s
because American actions are the things that I can <i>do</i>
something about. So even if the United States were causing only a
tiny fraction of the repression and violence in the world&mdash;which
obviously is very far from the truth&mdash;that tiny fraction would
still be what I&rsquo;m responsible for, and what I should focus my
efforts against. And that&rsquo;s based on a very simple ethical
principle &mdash;namely, that the ethical value of one&rsquo;s
actions depends on their anticipated consequences for human beings: I
think that&rsquo;s kind of like a fundamental moral truism.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for example, it
was a very easy thing in the 1980s for people in the United States to
denounce the atrocities of the Soviet Union in its occupation of
Afghanistan&mdash;but those denunciations had no effects which could
have helped people. In terms of their ethical value, they were about
the same as denouncing Napoleon&rsquo;s atrocities, or things that
happened in the Middle Ages. Useful and significant actions are ones
which have consequences for human beings, and usually those will
concern things that you can influence and control&mdash;which means
for people in the United States, American actions primarily, not
those of some other state.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, the
principle that I think we ought to follow is the principle we rightly
expected Soviet dissidents to follow. So what principle did we expect
Sakharov [a Soviet scientist punished for his criticism of the
U.S.S.R.] to follow? Why did people here decide that Sakharov was a
moral person? I think he was. Sakharov did not treat every atrocity
as identical&mdash;he had nothing to say about American atrocities.
When he was asked about them, he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
anything about them, I don&rsquo;t care about them, what I talk about
are Soviet atrocities.&rdquo; And that was right&mdash;because those
were the ones that he was responsible for, and that he might have
been able to influence. Again, it&rsquo;s a very simple ethical
point: you are responsible for the predictable consequences of <i>your</i>
actions, you&rsquo;re not responsible for the predictable
consequences of somebody else&rsquo;s actions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, we understand
this perfectly well when we&rsquo;re talking about dissidents in the
old Soviet Union or in some other enemy state, but we fail to
understand it when we&rsquo;re talking about ourselves&mdash;for
obvious reasons. I mean, commissars in the old Soviet Union didn&rsquo;t
understand it about dissidents there either: commissars in the old
Soviet Union attacked Sakharov and other Soviet dissidents because
they weren&rsquo;t denouncing <i>American</i> crimes. In fact, an old
joke fifty years ago was that if you went to a Stalinist and
criticized the Soviet slave-labor camps, the Stalinist would say,
&ldquo;Well, what about the lynchings in the American South?&rdquo;
Alright, in that case the dishonesty&rsquo;s obvious, and we can
easily understand why.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, just personally
speaking, it turns out that I <i>do</i> spend a fair amount of effort
talking about the crimes of official enemies&mdash;in fact, there are
a number of people now living in the United States and Canada from
the old Soviet Union and Eastern Europe who are there because of my
own personal activities on their behalf. But I don&rsquo;t take great
pride in that part of my work, particularly: I just do it because I&rsquo;m
interested in it. The most important thing for me, and for you, is to
think about the greater consequences of your criticisms: what you can
have the most effect on. And especially in a relatively open society
like ours, which does allow a lot of freedom for dissent, that means
American crimes primarily.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
the main point here, I think. But there&rsquo;s also another
consideration which is important&mdash;and which simply can&rsquo;t
be ignored, in my opinion. Honest people are just going to have to
face the fact that whenever possible, people with power are going to
exploit any actions which serve their violent ends. So when American
dissidents criticize the atrocities of some enemy state like Cuba or
Vietnam or something, it&rsquo;s no secret what the effects of that
criticism are going to be: it&rsquo;s not going have any effect
whatsoever  on the Cuban regime, for example, but it certainly will
help the torturers in Washington and Miami to keep inflicting their
campaign of suffering on the Cuban population [i.e. through the
U.S.-led embargo]. Well, that is something I do not think a moral
person would want to contribute to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, if a Russian
intellectual had started publishing articles denouncing very real
atrocities committed by the Afghan resistance forces at the time of
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, knowing that his accurate
criticism would have helped enable the Kremlin to mobilize popular
support for further atrocities by the Red Army, I do not think that
would have been a morally responsible thing for that person to do. Of
course, this often creates difficult dilemmas. But again, honest
people have to recognize that they are responsible for the
predictable consequences of their acts. So perfectly accurate
criticism of the regime in Cuba, say, will predictably be used by
ideologists and politicians in the United States to help extend our
absolutely barbaric stranglehold on Cuba. Your criticism could be
perfectly correct&mdash;though obviously much of what we do hear
today is in fact false. But even so, an honest person will always
ask, &ldquo;What are the likely consequences of this going to be for
other people?&rdquo; And the consequences in that case at least are
clear. Well, making decisions in these circumstances can often be
difficult&mdash;but these are just dilemmas that human beings have to
face in life, and all you can do is try to deal with them the best
way you can.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8708_2032848809"></a>Canada&rsquo;s
Media<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: I&rsquo;m
from Canada, Professor Chomsky, and when I come to the United States
and turn on the T.V., to me the propaganda all seems so blatant&mdash;I
see this woman talking about guilt and abortion, there&rsquo;s this
black woman saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m on welfare because I&rsquo;m
lazy,&rdquo; it&rsquo;s just one image like that after another,
there&rsquo;s no subtlety to it whatsoever. On Canadian T.V. it&rsquo;s
more subtle: the C.B.C. [Canadian Broadcasting Corporation] wouldn&rsquo;t
put on the black woman saying, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lazy, I&rsquo;m on
welfare because I&rsquo;m lazy&rdquo;&mdash;they&rsquo;d put up a
chart or something that tries to say the same thing.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: The Globe
and Mail [self-billed &ldquo;Canada&rsquo;s National Newspaper&rdquo;]
also is more subtle than the papers I see here&mdash;it&rsquo;s not
as obvious. What I&rsquo;m wondering is, how do you explain this
difference in the two countries&rsquo; media systems? I mean, I don&rsquo;t
think I could apply the &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo; you and Edward
Herman laid out in Manufacturing Consent to the Canadian media&mdash;it
really wouldn&rsquo;t work.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think you could,
actually&mdash;I think you&rsquo;re wrong about that. Let me just
give you some examples. The first part of my book <i>Necessary
Illusions</i> was  made up of talks on the media that I was invited
to give in Canada over C.B.C. national public radio [titled &ldquo;Thought
Control in Democratic Societies&rdquo;]. Okay, obviously that would
never happen in the United States.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">29</font></sup>
So that&rsquo;s a difference.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
in preparation for those lectures I figured that it would be
interesting to compare the <i>Globe and Mail</i>, Canada&rsquo;s main
newspaper, with the <i>New York Times,</i> and maybe I&rsquo;d
discuss the results in my talks. So for a year I subscribed to the
<i>Globe and Mail</i>&mdash;which I must say cost about $1,500 or
something in the United States, and apparently all their U.S.
subscribers are rich investors, because every two weeks or so you&rsquo;d
get a big fat glossy book about investment opportunities in Canada.
But anyhow, for about a year I read the <i>Globe and Mail</i> every
day and the <i>New York Times</i> every day, plus all the other junk,
and at first I figured it would be an interesting comparison.
Alright, it turned out that it <i>wasn&rsquo;t</i> an interesting
comparison. Reading the <i>Globe and Mail</i> is like reading the
<i>Boston Globe</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;s like an ordinary, quality local
newspaper in the United States: small amount of international
coverage, huge amount of business news, and mostly picking stories
off sources in the United States.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it&rsquo;s true
that over that year I did find things in the <i>Globe and Mail</i>
which did not appear in the United States, or which appeared only in
really remote places. And also I have friends in the Canadian media
who clip the Canadian press regularly for me, and they often find
stuff there that doesn&rsquo;t appear anywhere in the United States.
So you&rsquo;re right, there are some differences. But overall,
reading the <i>Globe and Mail</i> for a year, I didn&rsquo;t get a
different picture of the world than I get from reading the <i>Boston
Globe</i> or the <i>L.A. Times</i> or any other quality local
newspaper in the United States. The <i>Globe and Mail</i> was more
local in orientation and less international than the <i>New York
Times</i>, but I didn&rsquo;t feel that it was qualitatively
different&mdash;it&rsquo;s mostly a business paper like all the
others.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, when I go to
Canada, I do get asked onto mainstream national radio and television
a lot, as distinct from here&mdash;a lot. But see, that&rsquo;s
because I criticize the United States, and in Canada they like it
when people come up and dump on the United States&mdash;because the
United States is always pushing them around all the time, so it&rsquo;s
nice if somebody comes and says how rotten the United States is once
in a while. On the other hand, I got sick of this a couple times, and
I started talking about Canada&mdash;and I was off so fast you
couldn&rsquo;t even see it. The first time I did it was on this big
morning radio show they have there, with this guy whose name I can
never remember . . .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Peter
Gzowski.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Gzowski, yeah.
There&rsquo;s this nation-wide radio talk show in Canada which
everybody tunes into some time in the morning [<i>Morningside</i>, on
C.B.C.], and every time I&rsquo;d go to Toronto they would invite me
to come on that show. So we&rsquo;d have whatever it is, fifteen
minutes, and this guy would  ask me some leading questions, I&rsquo;d
tell him how rotten the United States is, big smile.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, one time I
really got sick of this, and I started talking about Canada. He said
some line about, &ldquo;I hear you just flew in.&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;Yeah, I landed at the War Criminal Airport.&rdquo; He said:
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;Well, you know, the
Lester B. Pearson Airport.&rdquo; And he says, &ldquo;What do you
mean, &lsquo;war criminal&rsquo;?&rdquo; Lester Pearson&rsquo;s the
big hero in Canada [he was a prominent diplomat and Prime Minister
from 1963 to &rsquo;68]. So I started running through Pearson&rsquo;s
involvement in criminal activity&mdash;he was a major criminal,
really extreme. He didn&rsquo;t have the power to be like an American
President, but if he&rsquo;d had it, he would have been the same&mdash;he
tried, you know. And I went through some of this.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">30</font></sup>
The guy got infuriated.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Then I said
something about Canada and the Vietnam War&mdash;Canada was always
denouncing the United States during the Vietnam War for its criminal
actions, meanwhile Canada was probably the leading military exporter
in the world per capita, enriching itself on the destruction of
Indochina. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">31</font></sup>
So I mentioned some of this stuff. He went into kind of a tantrum. I
actually thought it was sort of funny, but apparently his listeners
didn&rsquo;t&mdash;when I left, after about ten minutes of listening
to this harangue, the producer, sort of quivering, stopped me and
said: &ldquo;Oh my God, the switchboard&rsquo;s lighting up, we&rsquo;re
getting thousands of phone calls from all over Canada.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And apparently the
phone calls were all just about the fact that this guy Gzowski was
being impolite&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if people agreed with me
particularly, but there were a lot of people who were very angry at
the way he was going about it. Like I said, I thought it was comical,
didn&rsquo;t bother me.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: I&rsquo;m
sorry, they got angry at him?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>Him</i>, yeah&mdash;and
they were pretty upset, because there were a lot of calls. Alright,
so then the producer asked me &ldquo;Well, look, could you go on
again?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m leaving; I&rsquo;m
busy while I&rsquo;m here, and then I&rsquo;m going home, I don&rsquo;t
have that kind of time.&rdquo; So he said, &ldquo;Well, can we call
you in Boston to do a follow-up?&rdquo;&mdash;which they never do,
it&rsquo;s an in-studio program. So I said, &ldquo;Okay, if you can
arrange it, I&rsquo;ll do it.&rdquo; Anyway, they made a big effort,
they called me up in Boston, and we went through another show&mdash;in
which Gzowski was very contrite and quiet, just to make up to the
audience. But that was the last time I ever heard from them; I&rsquo;ve
never been asked on that show with him again.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And that&rsquo;s
happened to me elsewhere in Canada too, I should say&mdash;I mean,
I&rsquo;ve been invited to universities in Canada where they&rsquo;ve
literally refused to pay my plane fare after I gave talks in which I
denounced Canada. So you know, Canada&rsquo;s very nice as long as
you&rsquo;re criticizing the United States&mdash;try going after
Canada and see what happens to you.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is, I
think the media system works the same in both countries.  I don&rsquo;t
think it works the same in <i>detail</i>&mdash;like, there&rsquo;s a
labor movement there, and there are other factors that are different
between the two countries as well which may influence the range of
coverage a bit. But I doubt that the differences in the media product
are very great&mdash;and if you examine the question in detail, I&rsquo;m
pretty sure that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll find as well.</p>

</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: In Canada
there&rsquo;s been a strong movement for Quebec to separate from the
English-speaking part of the country&mdash;do you think it would be
in Quebec&rsquo;s self-interest to become independent like that? And
also, do you think it would be to the advantage of American business
to see that kind of instability in Canada, or is it better for
powerful interests here if Canada just remains stable?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I don&rsquo;t
know the whole situation in detail, but my guess is that it&rsquo;s
in Quebec&rsquo;s self-interest to stay part of Canada&mdash;because
the alternative is to become part of the United States. Quebec&rsquo;s
not going to be able to remain independent, so it can either become
part of the United States or stay part of Canada. And given that
choice, I think it&rsquo;s better off staying part of Canada. I mean,
if Quebec became independent from Canada, it wouldn&rsquo;t
necessarily be <i>called</i> part of the United States&mdash;like it
wouldn&rsquo;t get colored the same as the United States on the
map&mdash;but it would be so integrated into the American economy
that it would effectively be a colony. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s
in the interest of the people of Quebec, I think they&rsquo;re better
off staying part of Canada.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As for American
business, I suspect that powerful interests in the United States
would more or less prefer things to stay the way they are&mdash;just
because it&rsquo;s too disruptive: you don&rsquo;t know what all the
consequences of separation would be. The way the relationship between
the two countries is now, things sort of work&mdash;and after all,
all of Canada is going to become a colony of the United States
anyway, through things like N.A.F.T.A., so why go and pick off one
piece and have all of these other disruptive effects?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Remember, people
here were trying to take over Canada as early as the 1770s&mdash;it&rsquo;s
not a new idea. And if you look back at the history of the two
countries, in 1775&mdash;before the American Revolution even
began&mdash;the American colonists had already invaded Canada, and
had to be driven back by the British [the Continental Congress&rsquo;s
first act before declaring independence from Britain was to send an
invasion force to Canada in the unsuccessful &ldquo;Quebec
Campaign&rdquo;]. Then through the nineteenth century, the only
reason the U.S. didn&rsquo;t conquer Canada was that the British
forces in Canada were just too strong to allow it [e.g. invading
American forces were repulsed by British and Canadian soldiers
several times in the War of  1812]. And ever since then, it&rsquo;s
just been a matter of the United States integrating Canada into our
economy through other means: the so-called Free Trade Agreement of
1989 gave that a big shot forward, N.A.F.T.A. is accelerating it
still further, and it is very quickly taking place.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8712_2032848809"></a>Deciphering
&ldquo;China&rdquo;<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, China
has been in the news a lot recently, especially in light of their
resistance to intellectual property rights, and worldwide concern
over some of their extremely destructive environmental practices and
human rights abuses. What I&rsquo;m wondering is, what do you think
would be viable diplomatic measures now to improve U.S. relations
with China?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I don&rsquo;t
know&mdash;do we <i>want</i> to improve relations with China? China&rsquo;s
a very brutal society, a brutal government: I don&rsquo;t feel any
particular interest in improving relations with it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, the ways in
which issues are framed for us in the media and in the mainstream
culture typically involve so many assumptions and presuppositions
that you&rsquo;re kind of trapped as soon as you get into a
discussion of them&mdash;you&rsquo;re trapped in a discussion you
don&rsquo;t want to be in. And I think you have to start by taking
apart the assumptions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So I don&rsquo;t
think we should be asking the question &ldquo;How do we improve
relations with China?&rdquo;&mdash;we should be asking other
questions, like &ldquo;What kind of relations do we want to have with
China?&rdquo; And when we talk about &ldquo;China,&rdquo; who exactly
do we mean? China has a very wealthy sector now&mdash;businessmen,
bureaucrats and others, the guys who make the decisions&mdash;and
when the U.S. press talks about &ldquo;China,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s who
they mean. But there are plenty of other people in China too. So for
example, you take these Southeastern sections of China which are
supposed to be &ldquo;economic miracles&rdquo; and huge growth
areas&mdash;yeah, they&rsquo;re economic miracles alright, but a good
deal of that growth is because of foreign investment, which means
absolutely horrendous working conditions. So you have women from
farms who are locked into factories where they work 12 hours a day
for essentially nothing, and sometimes a couple hundred of them will
be burned to death because there&rsquo;s a factory fire and the
factory doors have been locked so no one can leave, and so on and so
forth.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">32</font></sup>
Well, that&rsquo;s &ldquo;China&rdquo; too&mdash;and the same is true
of any other country. So which &ldquo;China&rdquo; are we talking
about?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, in this
case there&rsquo;s also a geographical split, there&rsquo;s a
geographical break between Southeast China, which is a big growth
area, and Central China, where most of the population still lives,
and where things are maybe even going downhill in terms of
development and modernization. Well, the differences between those
areas are so substantial that some China specialists suspect that
China may just break apart into a more coastal area that&rsquo;s
part of the general East Asian growth area, with a lot of Japanese
capital and overseas Chinese capital and foreign investment feeding
into it, and then a big area with hundreds of millions of people
living in it which is kind of like a declining peasant society&mdash;surely
not part of the big growth rate, and maybe even declining.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">33</font></sup>
So even within the geographical entity that&rsquo;s called &ldquo;China,&rdquo;
there are regions that are like completely different countries, and
in some areas things could go back, as some suspect, even to the days
of peasant wars and other things like that. So, again, you have to
ask what exactly you mean by &ldquo;China.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And in fact, if you
look still more closely, the big &ldquo;economic growth&rdquo; areas
in China <i>themselves</i> are not so simple. So it turns out that a
good deal of the economic growth in those regions is coming from
cooperative structures, not from foreign-based investment&mdash;I
mean, nobody&rsquo;s really studied these cooperatives in detail,
because China&rsquo;s such a closed society, but they&rsquo;re not
private enterprise and they&rsquo;re not foreign investment, they&rsquo;re
some other thing. But certainly they have been picking up, and they
do have kind of a cooperative structure. And you don&rsquo;t have to
go to &ldquo;lefty&rdquo; magazines to find this out&mdash;there are
articles about it in mainstream journals like <i>The Economist</i>
and the <i>Asian Wall Street Journal</i> and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">34</font></sup>
Well, those cooperatives are a big part of the growth of Southeast
China, and they represent very different interests from the foreign
investment-driven industrial structures, with all their horrendously
exploitative conditions. So that&rsquo;s yet another &ldquo;China.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And like I say,
within all the various &ldquo;Chinas&rdquo; one can identify, there
always are different sectors of the population with differing
interests: like, for people working in the electronics factories and
toy factories in Guangdong Province, life is anything but pretty,
they live under absolutely horrible conditions&mdash;but there&rsquo;s
also a managerial elite sector that is growing and getting rich at
the same time. So I think the first step in figuring out what to do
about policies towards something like &ldquo;China&rdquo; has to be
to dismantle all the assumptions and presuppositions and biases
behind the issues as they&rsquo;re being presented by the
institutions. And while I don&rsquo;t think there are anything like
simple answers, on some of these issues of conflict that you read
about in the media now, I think it&rsquo;s a very mixed story.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Take intellectual
property rights. The Chinese leadership hasn&rsquo;t completely
accepted intellectual property rights, it hasn&rsquo;t completely
accepted these new developments to ensure that rich and powerful
corporations have a monopoly on technology and information&mdash;so
now the U.S. is using various sanctions against them to try to force
compliance. Well, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m in favor of <i>that.</i>
Like, I don&rsquo;t think I want to improve <i>those</i> relations
with China, what I would like to do is to dismantle this whole crazy
system.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or look at the fact
that China is one of the only countries in the world that imprisons
its population at roughly the same level as the United States&mdash;the
United States is way in the lead of other countries that keep
statistics  on imprisonment, and while we don&rsquo;t have precise
statistics on China, from the work that&rsquo;s been done by
criminologists who&rsquo;ve tried to make sense of it, it looks as
though they&rsquo;re roughly in our ballpark.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">35</font></sup>
Well, is that a good thing&mdash;that they throw huge amounts of
their population in jail like we do? I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a
great thing. And it&rsquo;s probable that their prison system is even
as brutal as ours, maybe worse. Well, the U.S. government and U.S.
power systems certainly don&rsquo;t care about that&mdash;any more
than they care about the fact that the <i>United States</i> is
imprisoning its population at a rate way beyond anyone else in the
world; in fact, that&rsquo;s going up right now. So that can&rsquo;t
be why U.S. relations with China are bad.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There was some talk
in the U.S. media a while ago about prison labor in China&mdash;but
take a close look at that discussion. The only objection to prison
labor in China that you heard was that the <i>products</i> of that
prison labor were being exported to the United States&mdash;hence
that&rsquo;s state industry, and the U.S. never wants state industry
to compete with privately owned U.S.-based firms. But if China wanted
to have prison labor and export it somewhere else, that was fine. In
fact, right at the time that the U.S. government and the media were
making a fuss about <i>Chinese</i> prison labor, the <i>United States</i>
was exporting products of prison labor to Asia: California and Oregon
were producing textiles in prisons which were being exported to Asia
under the name &ldquo;Prison Blues&rdquo;&mdash;didn&rsquo;t even try
to hide it. And in fact, prison production is going way up in the
United States right now.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">36</font></sup>
So there&rsquo;s no objection to prison labor in principle, just
don&rsquo;t interfere with the profits of American-based
corporations&mdash;that was the real meaning of that debate, when you
got to the core of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So what you want to
do on every issue, I think, is to extricate yourself from the way the
discussion is being presented in the official culture, and begin to
ask these kinds of questions about it. I mean, U.S. power doesn&rsquo;t
care much if the Chinese leaders murder dissidents, what they care
about is that the Chinese leaders let them make money&mdash;and I
don&rsquo;t think that is something which ordinary people in the
United States ought to buy into. I mean, China&rsquo;s a very
complicated, big story, and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s
anything like a simple answer as to what should be done in terms of
U.S. relations: like anything else, you just have to look at all the
various subparts. But the first step, I think, as with everything, is
to reframe in your mind what&rsquo;s really going on, remind yourself
what the real issues are, and not get trapped in discussions you
don&rsquo;t want to be part of in the first place.</p>

Killing Fields: U.S.-Backed Genocide in East Timor<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, a
little earlier you mentioned the East Timor massacre. I&rsquo;m an
organizer on that issue in Canada, and it seems to me that some
encouraging things have been happening in the big picture on that in
the past few years, in terms of maybe pressuring Indonesia to
withdraw and stop their extermination sometime in the future. Do you
agree with that kind of optimistic assessment at all?</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.15in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 0.28in">
<i>[Editors&rsquo; Note: Indonesia finally was forced to hold a
referendum in which the East Timorese voted for independence in
September 1999. The following discussion of the media, the great
powers, and popular activism&mdash;given before those events&mdash;provides
critical background.]</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it&rsquo;s
very hard to quantify, but I think you&rsquo;re right. I mean, I
don&rsquo;t know Indonesia that well myself, but people who do, like
Ben Anderson [American professor], say they definitely find something
positive taking place there. I hope so&mdash;but you know, it&rsquo;s
really up to <i>us</i> what happens in East Timor: what happens there
is going to depend on how much pressure and activism ordinary people
in the Western societies can put together.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">First of all, does
everybody know the situation we&rsquo;re talking about? Want me to
summarize it? It&rsquo;s an extremely revealing case, actually&mdash;if
you really want to learn something about our own society and values,
this is a very good place to start. It&rsquo;s probably the biggest
slaughter relative to the population since the Holocaust, which makes
it not small. And this is genocide, if you want to use the term, for
which the United States continues to be directly responsible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">East Timor is a
small island north of Australia. Indonesia invaded it illegally in
1975, and ever since they have just been slaughtering people. It&rsquo;s
continuing as we speak, after more than two decades. And that
massacre has been going on because the United States has actively,
consistently, and crucially supported it: it&rsquo;s been supported
by every American administration, and also by the entire Western
media, which have totally silenced the story. The worst phase of the
killing was in the late 1970s during the Carter administration. At
that time, the casualties were about at the scale of the Pol Pot
massacres in Cambodia. Relative to the population, they were much
greater. But they were radically different from Pol Pot&rsquo;s in
one critical respect: nobody had any idea about how to stop the Pol
Pot slaughter, but it was trivial how to stop this one. And it&rsquo;s
still trivial how we can stop it&mdash;we can stop supporting it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Indonesia invaded
East Timor in 1975 with the explicit authorization of Gerald Ford and
Henry Kissinger [the American President and Secretary of State] .<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">37</font></sup>
Kissinger then at once (secretly, though it leaked) moved to increase
U.S. weapons and counterinsurgency equipment sales to Indonesia,
which already was about 90 percent armed with U.S. weapons. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">38</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s now known from leaked documents that the British,
Australians, and Americans all were aware of the invasion plans in
advance, and that they monitored its progress as it was unfolding. Of
course, they only applauded.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">39</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The U.S. media have
real complicity in genocide in this case. Before the invasion, news
coverage of East Timor had in fact been rather high in the United
States, surprisingly high actually&mdash;and the reason was that East
 Timor had been part of the Portuguese Empire, which was collapsing
in the 1970s, and there was a lot of concern back then that the
former Portuguese colonies might do what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;moving
towards Communism,&rdquo; meaning moving towards independence, which
is not allowed. So before the invasion, there was a lot of media
coverage of East Timor. After Indonesia attacked, coverage started to
decline&mdash;and then it declined very sharply. By 1978, when the
atrocities reached their peak, coverage reached flat zero, literally
zero in the United States and Canada, which has been another big
supporter of the occupation. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">40</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Around that same
time, the Carter administration moved to send new supplies of
armaments to Indonesia, because their army was running out of weapons
in the course of the slaughter. By then they&rsquo;d killed maybe a
hundred thousand people.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">41</font></sup>
The press did its job by shutting up about what was really going
on&mdash;when they did have coverage, it was just repetition of
grotesque lies by the State Department and Indonesian generals, a
complete whitewash. In fact, media coverage <i>to this day</i> has
always completely wiped out the U.S. record: the strongest criticism
you&rsquo;ll ever find is, &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t pay enough
attention to Timor,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The U.S. didn&rsquo;t try hard
enough to get Indonesia to stop its atrocities&rdquo; or something
like that.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">42</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s kind of like saying the Soviet Union didn&rsquo;t try hard
enough to bring freedom to Eastern Europe, or they didn&rsquo;t pay
enough attention to it&mdash;that was their problem.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And remember, the
U.S. role in all of this has never been a secret&mdash;it&rsquo;s in
fact been acknowledged very frankly. For instance, if you read the
memoirs of our U.N. ambassador at the time of the invasion, Daniel
Patrick Moynihan&mdash;who&rsquo;s greatly praised for his defense of
international law, incidentally&mdash;he says: &ldquo;The Department
of State desired that the U.N. prove utterly ineffective in whatever
measures it undertook. This task was given to me, and I carried it
forward with no inconsiderable success.&rdquo; Okay, then he goes on
to describe the effects of the invasion, which he was fully aware of:
he says, in the first couple of months it seemed &ldquo;some 60,000
persons had been killed . . . almost the proportion of casualties
experienced by the Soviet Union during the Second World War.&rdquo;
Alright, that&rsquo;s the Nazis, and that&rsquo;s Moynihan, the great
advocate of international law.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">43</font></sup>
And he&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s how it happened: the State
Department wanted things to turn out as they did, and he ensured that
they did. Moynihan&rsquo;s at least being honest, let&rsquo;s give
him credit for it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another thing that&rsquo;s
never reported, though it&rsquo;s completely public and was perfectly
well known at the time, is that one of the main reasons why the
Western powers supported the invasion was that there&rsquo;s a huge
offshore oil field in Timor&rsquo;s territorial waters, and before
1975 the Australians and the Western oil companies had been trying
unsuccessfully to make a deal with Portugal to exploit it. Well, they
hadn&rsquo;t had any luck with Portugal, and they figured an
independent East Timor would be even harder to deal with&mdash;but
they knew that Indonesia would be easy: that&rsquo;s one of our boys,
 we&rsquo;ve been running it ever since the huge massacre there in
1965 that the West applauded, when they wiped out the Communist Party
and killed maybe 600,000 people.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">44</font></sup>
So for instance, leaked diplomatic records in Australia show that
right around the time of the invasion, top Australian officials said
that they would do better with an Indonesian takeover, and that
Indonesia should be supported.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">45</font></sup>
Again, I have yet to see a word about any of this in the U.S. media.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And actually that
exploitation has been proceeding rather nicely: Australia and
Indonesia signed a big treaty to start extracting Timorese oil [in
December 1989], and right after the Dili massacre in 1991 [in which
Indonesians killed hundreds of unarmed Timorese protesters at a
funeral], the big Western reaction&mdash;apart from sending
additional arms to Indonesia&mdash;was that fifteen major oil
companies started exploration in the Timor Sea oil fields. Happily
for Chevron, there are apparently some very promising strikes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, to get back to
your question: even though this virtually genocidal massacre has
received almost no coverage from the U.S. press, a very small number
of people started working on the issue&mdash;literally it was a tiny
group of activists, probably not more than a dozen.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">46</font></sup>
And finally, after a few years, they&rsquo;ve gotten somewhere:
around the early 1980s, just through constant pressure and
organizing, they managed to get the media to start reporting on Timor
very occasionally. The coverage has been highly selective, and it
still always excludes the crucial role that the United States has
played, both in providing arms and in giving Indonesia the diplomatic
support they&rsquo;ve needed to maintain the occupation over the
years&mdash;but there has been some. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">47</font></sup>
And they&rsquo;ve gotten some Congressmen interested, mostly
conservative Congressmen, incidentally. Wider public pressure began
to develop; the East Timor Action Network was started&mdash;and there
has been a real change, just thanks to this small, indeed growing,
number of activists.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In 1992, the
pressure actually got to the point that Congress passed legislation
banning U.S. military training for Indonesian officers because of
their &ldquo;human rights violations,&rdquo; which is putting it
pretty mildly. That put the Clinton administration in kind of an
embarrassing position, but they got out of it alright: they announced
that the law didn&rsquo;t mean what it said, it only meant that the
United States couldn&rsquo;t train Indonesian military officers <i>with
money from the United States itself</i>, but if the Indonesians paid
for the training themselves&mdash;say, with money we gave them from
some other pocket&mdash;that would be fine. With rare delicacy, the
State Department picked the anniversary of the invasion to announce
this interpretation, and although Congress protested, it went
through.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">48</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Nevertheless, the
legislation was a very important development, and I think it&rsquo;s
a sign of a real change that could take place, as you suggest. I
mean, with enough popular pressure, this is one of those issues that
could turn around: the Indonesians could pull out, they may well be
close to it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, if we&rsquo;re
talking about activism, this is a very revealing case&mdash; because
if you can organize successfully on an issue like East Timor, you can
do it on almost anything. It&rsquo;s a pretty hard topic to get
people interested in, you&rsquo;d think, yet popular pressure here
has forced things to the point of at least symbolic gestures by the
U.S. government&mdash;and symbolic gestures on the part of the United
States are very important. Remember, everyone in the world is scared
shitless of us: we&rsquo;re a brutal terrorist power of enormous
strength, and if you get in our way, you&rsquo;re in trouble. Nobody
steps on Uncle Sam&rsquo;s toes. So when the United States Congress
makes a symbolic gesture like banning military-training aid or
banning small-arms sales, the Indonesian generals hear it, even if
they can get whatever they want from some other country, or even from
Bill Clinton in the end.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8716_2032848809"></a>Mass
Murderers at Harvard<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, let me
give you another example of the kinds of things that have been
happening on this&mdash;this one is really relevant, it shows you can
really do things. In Boston recently there was a court case, in which
an Indonesian general was sued by the mother of a boy who was killed
in the Dili massacre in 1991. Her name is Helen Todd, which explains
why the suit went through, if you can figure that part out. . . .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What happened is, in
November 1991, some Indonesian troops in East Timor opened fire on a
funeral march with their U.S.-supplied M-16s, and killed about 250
people. That&rsquo;s fairly routine there, actually, but this time
the Indonesians made a mistake: a couple of Western reporters were
there filming it all, and they managed to bury the videotape in an
open grave and have it smuggled out of the country a couple days
later. The Indonesian soldiers also nearly beat two American
journalists to death, so this one became pretty difficult for the
international media to ignore.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">49</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, as Indonesia
was carrying out its cover-up after this with the help of some big
public relations firm they hired in the U.S. [Burson-Marsteller,
Inc.], one of the things they did was to get the generals out of the
way so nobody would see them, and one of them was sent off to
Harvard, to study.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">50</font></sup>
Alright, some local people in Boston found out about this, and they
checked with Harvard: Harvard claimed they&rsquo;d never heard of
him. But he was there, he was studying at the Kennedy School of
Government at Harvard&mdash;so people started to protest his presence
there. The protests began to build up, there was more and more
pressure, then on the first anniversary of the Dili massacre came my
favorite <i>Boston Globe</i> headline in history. It said,
&ldquo;Indonesian General, Facing Suit, Flees Boston.&rdquo; And
indeed, that&rsquo;s what happened&mdash;he fled Boston, and hasn&rsquo;t
been seen there since.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">51</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Meanwhile, the suit
continued on without him. There&rsquo;s a law in the United States
which says that you can bring civil suits for damages against
torturers and murderers and human rights abusers and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">52</font></sup>
So the judge heard the testimony of Helen Todd, journalist Allan
Nairn and others,  and was impressed&mdash;and the General now has a
$14 million fine to pay in case he ever decides to show up here
again.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">53</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The same thing
happened the next year with one of Guatemala&rsquo;s leading killers,
incidentally, General Gramajo&mdash;whom the U.S. State Department
was grooming to become the next Guatemalan President. He was one of
the big mass murderers from the early 1980s, and he was also shipped
off to Harvard to refine his skills. Well, people in Boston found out
about it by reading the Central American press, so they approached
Harvard. Again, &ldquo;Never heard of him.&rdquo; But he was there.
Alright, then Allan Nairn, who&rsquo;s a very enterprising
journalist, and imaginative&mdash;one of the few journalists in the
country, actually&mdash;waited until the Harvard commencement
ceremonies to move in. Harvard graduations are televised locally, and
as the murderer General Gramajo was walking up to the platform to
receive his degree, Nairn raced in front of the television cameras
and served him with a subpoena. That one, he fled Boston too. The
case came to court and he was fined $47 million.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">54</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you know, that
just shows you can do things. Indonesia is getting worried about
their image here, very worried. And it&rsquo;s starting to get to the
point where they might actually allow a referendum or something on
self-determination for East Timor&mdash;it&rsquo;s a possibility.
Alatas, their Foreign Minister, in fact made a speech a little while
ago in which he described East Timor as &ldquo;a piece of gravel in
our shoe&rdquo;: you know, we have to get rid of this thing.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">55</font></sup>
But of course, it&rsquo;s going to take a lot more sustained pressure
and activism here to ever achieve anything like that. And in fact, if
it&rsquo;s going to be successful, that pressure will have to be
international and coordinated around the world&mdash;because Britain
and Australia and places like that will be perfectly happy to take up
the slack and make as much money as they can selling arms to
Indonesia if the United States ever were to seriously back off.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">56</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8718_2032848809"></a>Changes
in Indonesia<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But there are
definitely things going on in Indonesia which are quite
encouraging&mdash;and which make your sense of optimism seem
justified, I think. For example, did you follow the case of this
Indonesian academic, Aditjondro? There&rsquo;s a well-known
Indonesian professor who teaches at a fairly major university there,
who recently went public about his opposition to the annexation of
East Timor during a visit to Australia&mdash;and it turns out that
for about twenty years he&rsquo;s been doing research on East Timor
in secret, and he released a lot of extremely interesting and
detailed documentation. For instance, he had the names of about 270
people killed in the Dili massacre, and they checked out; he had done
studies of other atrocities, he gave very strong statements.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the Australian
press silenced it. Anybody from Australia here? The  only place it
got published was West Perch, wherever the hell that is&mdash;probably
some kind of cow-town in Australia. But it did get published there,
and then it kind of seeped out into the international media, pushed
on by things like the Internet. And finally it got to be kind of an
international affair&mdash;though of course, as usual there was never
a word about it in the U.S. media.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">57</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Anyway, this guy
Aditjondro went back to Indonesia&mdash;and to everybody&rsquo;s
amazement, nothing&rsquo;s happened to him. I was just talking to
John Pilger [an Australian political activist and filmmaker] two days
ago, and he&rsquo;d just seen him and been in touch with him&mdash;he&rsquo;s
still traveling around the country, and so far they&rsquo;ve left him
alone.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">58</font></sup>
Alright, that&rsquo;s a sign, you know. And there are others.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, I just saw
one in this morning&rsquo;s newspaper. This week, authorities in
Indonesia arrested a bunch of labor leaders, which is not good. But
what <i>is</i> good is that they arrested them for a reason&mdash;namely,
they had been organizing, and carrying out strikes. See, the labor
movement in Indonesia is in some ferment, and as a matter of fact,
the Indonesian government recently was compelled just by internal
pressures to acknowledge the existence of an independent labor union
in the country. Now, I don&rsquo;t know how far these things will go,
but they&rsquo;re the sign of a change.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">59</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another sign is that
if you talk to students from Indonesia, it&rsquo;s clear that they
know more than they used to. It used to be like total fascism&mdash;they
didn&rsquo;t know anything about politics or the world. But it&rsquo;s
become much less controlled in recent years: now they&rsquo;ve kind
of heard about things, they&rsquo;re more aware, they&rsquo;re more
concerned to try to change things a bit.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">60</font></sup>
And one could go on like this&mdash;but these are all indications of
internal changes in Indonesia, and they are in part a reaction to
Western pressure. And Indonesia reacts very quickly to Western
pressure. In fact, if there was ever any serious pressure from the
West, the occupation of East Timor would be over tomorrow.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This point was just
illustrated very clearly, actually. Look: the United States, Canada,
England, France, Holland, Sweden, Germany, Japan, any country that
can make a buck off it, are all involved in this&mdash;so it&rsquo;s
really not a question of us laying economic sanctions on Indonesia to
pressure &ldquo;them,&rdquo; the only real question is, can <i>we</i>
stop killing Timorese? However, there <i>was</i> a case recently
where the major Western powers did threaten economic sanctions
against Indonesia&mdash;it&rsquo;s not too well known, but it&rsquo;s
extremely instructive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In 1993, the World
Health Organization voted to request that the World Court consider
the legality of the use of nuclear weapons, and issue an opinion on
it. Well, obviously the United States and Britain went totally
berserk when they heard about this: just the fact that the World
Court might <i>hear</i> a case on the legality of nuclear weapons is
already a contribution to nuclear non-proliferation. And of course,
we benefit from proliferation, since we&rsquo;re the main producer,
seller, and possessor of nuclear weapons. I mean, it&rsquo;s not  as
if anybody would <i>listen</i> to the World Court if it said that the
use of nuclear weapons is illegal (which means by implication that
<i>possession</i> of them is illegal too)&mdash;but it would
certainly be a big publicity coup for the disarmament movement if it
did. So for the big nuclear powers, this was a major issue. Actually,
it&rsquo;s of particular significance for Britain, because one of
Britain&rsquo;s last claims to being a country, instead of like a
county of the United States, is that they have nuclear weapons&mdash;so
for them it&rsquo;s important on a symbolic level. And nuclear
weapons are important to the United States because they&rsquo;re part
of the way we intimidate everyone&mdash;we intervene around the world
under what&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;nuclear umbrella,&rdquo; which
serves as kind of a cover to back up our conventional intervention
forces.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that year
Indonesia was serving as the head of the Non-Aligned Movement at the
U.N. [a coalition of Third World nations in the General Assembly],
and the 110 countries of the Non-Aligned Movement decided to
introduce a resolution endorsing this request for an opinion&mdash;that&rsquo;s
all that was up, endorsement of a request for an opinion from the
World Court. The U.S., Britain and France immediately threatened
trade and aid sanctions against Indonesia if, in their role as head
of the Non-Aligned Movement for that year, they submitted this
resolution at the General Assembly. So Indonesia instantly withdrew
it, of course&mdash;when they get orders from the boss, they stop.
And they stop fast.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">61</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that just
shows that there are some atrocities that go too far for the Western
powers: genocide in East Timor we can support, but endorsement of a
request for an opinion on the legality of nuclear weapons is an
atrocity we simply cannot tolerate. But it also shows you what we can
do to Indonesia if we feel like it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8720_2032848809"></a>Nuclear
Proliferation and North Korea<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Just on the
subject of nuclear proliferation&mdash;what&rsquo;s the real problem
we&rsquo;ve had with North Korea supposedly wanting to build their
own nuclear weapons? The media and the Clinton administration say
they&rsquo;re all horrified by that prospect&mdash;is that what you
really think is bothering them?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s very
interesting in connection with this World Court story, isn&rsquo;t
it&mdash;because part of what we claim is the problem with North
Korea is that their getting nuclear weapons would threaten the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. But if we&rsquo;re so concerned
with non-proliferation, obviously nothing would be more of a shot in
the arm for it than this World Court decision we tried so desperately
to block. Okay, that tells you something about our motives in all of
this. But actually, I think the problem with North Korea is in fact
what they&rsquo;re saying: the wrong guys are getting possible power,
nuclear weapons.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, nobody in
their right mind would want North Korea to have nuclear  weapons. But
on the other hand, there&rsquo;s nothing much that they would <i>do</i>
with nuclear weapons if they had them, except maybe defend themselves
from attack. They&rsquo;re certainly not going to <i>invade</i>
anybody, that&rsquo;s not even imaginable: if they ever made a move,
the country gets destroyed tomorrow. So the only role that nuclear
weapons could play for them is as a deterrent to attack&mdash;and
that&rsquo;s not totally unrealistic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, it&rsquo;s a
pretty crazy country, and there&rsquo;s not very much good&mdash;there&rsquo;s
nothing good&mdash;you can say about the government. But no matter
who they were, if they were Mahatma Gandhi, they would be worried
about a possible attack. I mean, the United States was threatening
North Korea with nuclear weapons at least as late as the 1960s.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">62</font></sup>
And after all, just remember what we <i>did</i> to that country&mdash;it
was absolutely flattened. Here people may not be aware of what we did
to them, but <i>they</i> certainly know it well enough.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Towards the end of
what we call the &ldquo;Korean War&rdquo;&mdash;which was really just
one phase in a much longer struggle [beginning when the U.S.
destroyed the indigenous nationalist movement in Korea in the late
1940s]&mdash;the United States ran out of good bombing targets. We
had total command of the air of course, but there was nothing good
left to bomb&mdash;because everything had already been flattened. So
we started going after things like dikes. Okay, that&rsquo;s just a
major war crime.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">63</font></sup>
In fact, if you take a look at the official U.S. Air Force history of
the Korean War, it&rsquo;s absolutely mind-boggling, it&rsquo;s like
something straight out of the Nazi archives. I mean, these guys don&rsquo;t
conceal their glee at all, it&rsquo;s just this account of all their
terrific feelings: we bombed these dikes, and a huge flow of water
went through the valleys and carved out huge paths of destruction and
slaughtered people! And they say, laughingly: we don&rsquo;t realize
how important rice is for the Asians, so naturally they were
screaming with rage! I really can&rsquo;t duplicate, you have to read
it in the original.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">64</font></sup>
And the Koreans lived on the other end of that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Our treatment of
North Korean prisoners of war also was absolutely grotesque&mdash;again,
it was kind of like the Nazis. This is all documented in the West by
now, and of course <i>they</i> certainly know about it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">65</font></sup>
So there are plenty of things for the North Koreans to remember, and
plenty of things for them to be afraid of&mdash;which is not to
justify their getting nuclear weapons, but it&rsquo;s part of the
background we should keep in mind.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The other thing is,
North Korea is in a desperate situation right now: they&rsquo;re
hemmed in politically, and they&rsquo;re struggling very hard to
break out of their total isolation&mdash;they&rsquo;re setting up
free-trade zones, and trying to integrate themselves into the
international economic system, other things like that. Well, this is
apparently one of their ways of attempting to do it. It&rsquo;s
neither intelligent nor justifiable, but that&rsquo;s a part of
what&rsquo;s motivating them, and we should at least try to
understand that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As far as Western
concern about nuclear weapons goes, obviously it&rsquo;s highly
selective&mdash;like, nobody cares that the <i>United States</i> has
nuclear weapons, nobody cares that Israel has nuclear weapons, they
just don&rsquo;t  want them in the hands of people we don&rsquo;t
control, like North Korea. And I think that&rsquo;s really the main
issue behind the controversy these days.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Could you
say a few words more about the origins of the Korean War? I take it
you don&rsquo;t accept the standard picture that it began when the
U.S. moved to block a Communist expansionist invasion.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the fact of
the matter is that the Korean War is much more complex than the way
it&rsquo;s presented in mainstream circles. In this case,
incidentally, the scholarship is considerably better than is usual,
and if you look at the serious monograph literature on the Korean
War, you&rsquo;ll see that a different position is presented than the
one we always hear.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">66</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The 1950 North
Korean attack on the southern part of the country was really the tail
end of a long war. In fact, before North Korea attacked the South in
1950, already about 100,000 Koreans had been killed&mdash;that&rsquo;s
something we forget. What happened in Korea is essentially this. When
the American forces landed in 1945 at the end of World War II, they
found that an already functioning local government had been set up.
There had been an anti-Japanese resistance, and it had established
local administrations and Peoples&rsquo; Committees and so on, all
over North and South Korea. Well, when the United States moved into
the South, we dismantled all of that, destroyed it by force&mdash;we
used the Koreans who had collaborated with the Japanese, and in fact
even reinstituted the Japanese police to destroy it all [Japan had
occupied Korea for 35 years until its defeat in the Second World
War]. And that led to serious conflict in the South, a rather bitter
conflict which went on for four or five years with a lot of people
killed, and also there was a lot of cross-border fighting at the time
(going both ways, incidentally). Then there was sort of a lull, and
<i>then</i> came the North Korean attack going south. So there was
definitely a North Korean attack, but it was an intervention by the
North into the South after the United States had suppressed the
anti-Japanese resistance movement in a civil war. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">67</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, that puts a
slightly different color on it than the standard line we hear. For
example, if some country were&mdash;let&rsquo;s say&mdash;to conquer
the western part of the United States, and there was resistance
against that conquest, and then the resistance was suppressed with
say a hundred thousand people killed, and then the Eastern part of
the United States &ldquo;invaded&rdquo; the Western part, that
wouldn&rsquo;t be just an invasion: that would be a little too
simple. And something like that happened in Korea.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8722_2032848809"></a>The
Samson Option<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: You
mentioned Israel having nuclear weapons&mdash;would you expand on the
significance of that? I remember you used the title &ldquo;The Road
to Armageddon&rdquo; for the last chapter of your book on the Middle
East, The Fateful Triangle.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, that&rsquo;s
something I think is quite important, actually. I mean, that book was
written back in 1982, and what I was discussing at the end of it is
what in Israel for the last forty years or so has been called the
&ldquo;Samson Complex&rdquo;; later Sy Hersh wrote a book about it
called <i>The Samson Option</i> , but it&rsquo;s an old story that
goes back to the 1950s. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">68</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You know the story
of Samson in the Bible? At the end, Samson gets captured by the
Philistines, he&rsquo;s blinded, he&rsquo;s standing in the temple
between two pillars, and he pulls down the temple walls and crushes
all the people inside: the Bible says, &ldquo;He killed more
Philistines as he died than in all of his life.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">69</font></sup>
Well, that&rsquo;s the Samson Complex. What it means, translated into
straight politics&mdash;and they&rsquo;re pretty straight about
it&mdash;is: if anybody pushes us too far, we&rsquo;ll bring down the
universe.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, in order to do
that, Israel needed nuclear weapons&mdash;and they got them, with our
help.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">70</font></sup> In
the 1950s, when all of this stuff started, the threats were kind of
empty&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t bring down the temple walls. But
since the early 1960s, it&rsquo;s been imaginable, and it&rsquo;s in
fact something that&rsquo;s discussed quite openly in Israel: the
idea is, push us too hard and we&rsquo;ll do something wild, we&rsquo;ll
go crazy&mdash;and you&rsquo;ll all suffer. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">71</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for example,
according to the Israeli Labor Party press, when the Arab League
proposed a Saudi Arabian-initiated peace plan for the region in
August 1981, Israel sent U.S.-supplied F-14 fighters over the Saudi
Arabian oil fields as a warning to Western intelligence
agencies&mdash;meaning, if you take this peace plan seriously, you&rsquo;re
all going to be in trouble, we&rsquo;ll destroy those oil fields.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">72</font></sup>
Also back in the early 1980s, Israeli strategic analysts were
publicly saying&mdash;even in English, so everybody would hear
it&mdash;that Israel was developing nuclear-tipped missiles that
could reach the Soviet Union. It may have been false, but that&rsquo;s
at least what they were saying. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">73</font></sup>
Well, why would they need nuclear-tipped missiles that could reach
the Soviet Union? They&rsquo;re not going to attack Russia; they&rsquo;re
not going to deter a Russian attack&mdash;that&rsquo;s outlandish.
But the idea was, and everybody understood it at the time, that if
U.S. policy ever changes course and we decide to stop supporting
Israel, they&rsquo;ll attack Russia and draw Russia into the Middle
East&mdash;which would then probably destroy the world in a nuclear
war.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, now it seems
Russia&rsquo;s out of the game&mdash;maybe only temporarily, I might
say. But none of the underlying considerations have changed, and
there are obviously a lot of other similar scenarios like that
around. So the fact of the matter is, this is just going to remain an
extremely dangerous area.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Incidentally, one of
the nice things about the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the
Soviet Union is that top-level American planners are finally becoming
a bit more honest about some things. So for example, every year the
White House puts out a big glossy document explaining to Congress why
we need a huge military establishment&mdash;and for a long time it
was always the same story: the Russians are coming,
this-that-and-the-other-thing.  Well, after the fall of the Berlin
Wall, they had to change the computer disk for the first time. The
bottom line had to remain the same: we need a big military, a big
so-called &ldquo;defense&rdquo; infrastructure (read: support for
electronics)&mdash;but now the justification had to change. So in
1990, the reason they gave was no longer &ldquo;the Russians are
coming,&rdquo; it was what they called &ldquo;the technological
sophistication of Third World powers&rdquo;&mdash;especially ones in
the Middle East, where they said, our problems &ldquo;could not be
laid at the Kremlin&rsquo;s door.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, first true
statement: for the preceding fifty years, our problems always had
been &ldquo;laid at the Kremlin&rsquo;s door,&rdquo; but now that the
Kremlin&rsquo;s gone, we&rsquo;d might as well tell the truth about
it&mdash;because we still need the same policies.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">74</font></sup>
And in fact, just to make sure that there always <i>is</i> a real
danger, we also have to <i>sell</i> all these Third World powers
high-tech weaponry&mdash;the U.S. in fact very quickly became the
biggest arms dealer to the Third World after the Cold War ended.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">75</font></sup>
And the arms contractors of course <i>know</i> it: like, if you read
Lockheed-Martin corporate propaganda, they say, look, we&rsquo;ve got
to build the F-22 because we&rsquo;re selling advanced upgraded F-16s
to these Third World regimes, and we&rsquo;re selling them all kinds
of complicated air defense systems, and who knows, they&rsquo;re just
a bunch of dictators, maybe they&rsquo;ll turn against us&mdash;so
we&rsquo;ve got to build the F-22 to defend ourselves from all the
high-tech weapons we&rsquo;re selling them.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">76</font></sup>
And of course, that&rsquo;s all at the cost of the U.S. taxpayer, as
usual.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8724_2032848809"></a>The
Lot of the Palestinians<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, how do
you interpret the 1996 elections in Israel [in which the more
right-wing Likud Party, led by Benjamin Netanyahu, defeated the Labor
Party, which had negotiated the Oslo Accords in 1994]? And what do
you think the effect is going to be on the peace process that the
Labor Party was instituting with the Palestinians?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think it&rsquo;s
going to have almost no effect on that. &ldquo;Peace process&rdquo;
is a very funny word for what&rsquo;s happened, actually&mdash;it&rsquo;s
a &ldquo;peace process&rdquo; in the same sense that it was a &ldquo;peace
process&rdquo; in South Africa when they instituted apartheid [the
system of official white supremacy]. So when South Africa instituted
its apartheid system in the 1950s and set up the Bantustans
[partially self-governing black territories], that was also a &ldquo;peace
process&rdquo;&mdash;it stabilized the country, there was peace for a
while, and so on. Well, in many ways that&rsquo;s similar to what&rsquo;s
called &ldquo;the peace process&rdquo; in the Middle East right now,
although if you look closely, that comparison is not quite fair. It&rsquo;s
unfair to South Africa.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, the Bantustans
that South Africa set up in the 1950s were much more viable
economically than any scattered fragment that may someday  be allowed
for a Palestinian state under the Oslo Agreements. And furthermore,
South Africa subsidized its Bantustans: so if you go back to, say,
Transkei [Bantustan under apartheid until 1991], South Africa gave it
plenty of subsidies&mdash;in fact, a large part of the South African
budget went to subsidizing the Bantustans, which were relatively
viable areas economically. Well, Israel has never permitted any
development whatsoever in the Occupied Territories&mdash;in fact,
there was actually a military ordinance that no development would be
allowed there if it would be competitive with Israeli business.
They&rsquo;ve wanted the Territories to be a captive market, and
therefore there&rsquo;s been no development at all.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">77</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Israeli reporters
have covered this very well, actually. When they went to Jordan after
the peace treaty with Jordan [finalized in October 1994], even they
were shocked by the difference between it and the Occupied
Territories&mdash;and they wrote very interesting articles about
it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">78</font></sup>
Remember, Jordan is a poor Third World country: it hasn&rsquo;t had
any of the advantages that Israel has had in being the chief American
client-state, and before the 1967 war, the West Bank was somewhat
more developed than Jordan. Well, today the disparity is
extraordinary in the opposite direction. So in Jordan, there&rsquo;s
rich agriculture, and highways, and factories, and other things like
that&mdash;but right across the border, the West Bank is a total
disaster: Israel hasn&rsquo;t allowed a cent to go into it; in fact,
they&rsquo;ve taken a lot of money <i>out</i> of it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance, the
poor workers in the Israeli labor force over the years have mostly
been Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip&mdash;they did
the dirty work in Israel&rsquo;s economy. And theoretically they were
paid, but mostly theoretically&mdash;because from their pay, the
Israeli government deducted what is deducted from the pay of Jewish
workers, like deductions for pensions and health care and so on.
Except the Palestinian workers never got any of the benefits: the
money for their benefits just went right to the Israeli treasury.
Well, that amount is estimated to be about a billion dollars or so.
In fact, not long ago an Israeli civil rights group, partly made up
of law professors at the Hebrew University and partly just a workers&rsquo;
rights group [Kav La&rsquo;Oved], brought a lawsuit in the Israeli
courts to try to recover for these workers the roughly billion
dollars it&rsquo;s estimated has been stolen from them. Well, the
court recently decided the case&mdash;and it decided that the claims
were null and void because of the Oslo Agreements, which it said have
retroactively eliminated the basis for the suit by legalizing
Israel&rsquo;s confiscation of the funds. And furthermore, the
decision said that the purpose for making those deductions had never
been to ensure equal rights for the Palestinian workers in the first
place, it was just to ensure that their actual wages would be lower
than those of Jewish workers and to protect Israeli workers from
unfair competition by cheaper Palestinian labor. Okay? That was the
real purpose of taking the money from them. And then the court said
that this was a worthy and legitimate action, just like introducing
tariffs to protect domestic production is a legitimate action: so
therefore the robbery is retroactively justified.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">79</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
just one of the many ways in which Israel has taken plenty of wealth
from the Territories, including its water.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">80</font></sup>
And all of that is going to continue after the Oslo Agreements and
the recent election. So if you look at the peace treaty, everything
just keeps going to Israel&mdash;and that&rsquo;s not going to
change.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Furthermore, Israel
is not taking any responsibility for what it&rsquo;s done to the
Territories during the occupation [which began in 1967]: the peace
treaty in fact says explicitly that Israel has no liability for
anything that was done in that time, that&rsquo;s all the sole
responsibility of the Palestinian Authority. In fact, it&rsquo;s the
only thing that the Palestinian Authority <i>does</i> get full
responsibility for&mdash;everything else they don&rsquo;t get, but
they do get full responsibility for paying all the costs of the
occupation. And the treaty explicitly says that if there is any
<i>future</i> claim against Israel for something that happened during
the occupation, the Palestinian Authority also is responsible for
paying that claim and for reimbursing Israel if there are any charges
against Israel. So here as well, what&rsquo;s happened in the &ldquo;peace
process&rdquo; is not quite like South Africa: the South African
Bantustans were far more forthcoming.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, all of this is
just going to continue after the elections&mdash;I mean, the Likud
Party would be out of their minds if they didn&rsquo;t persist in all
this; the Oslo Agreements are such an overwhelming victory for Israel
that they&rsquo;d be insane if they didn&rsquo;t maintain them. So I
would not expect any of that to change.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, that&rsquo;s
not the standard story about the elections in the United States, of
course. For example, the <i>New York Times</i>&rsquo;s lead story in
their &ldquo;Week in Review&rdquo; section after the elections said,
flat out: the peace process is dead&mdash;everything the U.S. did is
finished, it&rsquo;s dead, it&rsquo;s over.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">81</font></sup>
But I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true at all&mdash;I think that&rsquo;s
based on a serious misunderstanding of what the &ldquo;peace process&rdquo;
was really about. Likud would be crazy not to persist with the
relations that have been established with the P.L.O. under the Oslo
Agreements&mdash;just as the white South African elites would have
been crazy not to continue pushing through the Bantustan process if
they could have gotten away with it. In fact, the main difference
between the two cases is that in the case of the Bantustans, nobody
in the international community recognized the arrangement as
legitimate&mdash;but in the case of the Israeli policy towards the
Occupied Territories now, everybody in the world at this point
basically supports it, thanks to U.S. power. In fact, the current
U.S. government, the Clinton administration, has gone way beyond any
of its predecessors in support for the most extremist Israeli
policies. The Israeli press is constantly astonished by it. For
instance, there was a big headline in a recent article in Israel,
which read, &ldquo;Clinton: The Last Zionist&rdquo;&mdash;you know,
the only one left who really believes all the bullshit. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">82</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you know, the
most important part of the &ldquo;peace agreement&rdquo; is its
complete termination of any possibility of self-determination for the
Palestinians:  they&rsquo;re finished as far as this goes, they get
nothing. As far as the Palestinian refugees are concerned, it&rsquo;s
finished. I mean, for years the United States went along with
rhetorical commitments about a &ldquo;just settlement&rdquo; of the
refugee problem; now it doesn&rsquo;t even do that anymore. On the
issue of control of Jerusalem, while the United States used to
rhetorically oppose the Israeli annexation and takeover, along with
the rest of the world, now that&rsquo;s over&mdash;the Clinton
administration doesn&rsquo;t even oppose it rhetorically anymore.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">83</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The terms of the
treaty are pretty amazing, they&rsquo;re really worth looking at:
they were pushed by the United States in such a way that the chance
of anything at all for the Palestinians is <i>very</i> minimal. So
people living in the Territories used to have two options: one was to
go somewhere else (which Israel hoped would happen, and did happen to
a considerable extent), and the other was to commute to Israel and be
kind of what in Europe are called &ldquo;guest workers,&rdquo; what
are called here &ldquo;illegal migrant labor&rdquo;&mdash;so they
would do the dirty work in Israel that nobody wanted, for a pittance,
essentially nothing. But now even that is being cut out&mdash;they&rsquo;re
not being allowed back into Israel.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">84</font></sup>
And Israel is now turning to another source: they have by now about
200,000 immigrants (it&rsquo;s maybe about 5 percent of the
population) from all over the world, from Ghana, Ecuador, lots of
them from Thailand, Romania, China, the Philippines. And these are
people essentially brought over for this purpose&mdash;who just live
under the most miserable conditions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The ones they sort
of like best are the Chinese, because they have a deal with the
Chinese government that if these people get out of hand&mdash;like if
they demand that they be paid their wages (which they&rsquo;re
usually not paid), or you know, they want to stop being beaten while
they&rsquo;re on the job or something&mdash;Israel can just call in
the Chinese authorities who will, as they put it, &ldquo;deal with
them.&rdquo; China&rsquo;s a rough, tough government, you know, so
they&rsquo;ll make sure that no one makes any fuss&mdash;and if they
<i>do</i> make a fuss, Israel will just send them home where they&rsquo;ll
be even worse off. So the Chinese workers are easier to discipline,
because of the cooperation of the Chinese authorities, and that&rsquo;s
something they like very much in Israel.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">85</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s a
very brutal system, and it ends up displacing the Palestinians&mdash;so
that means one of the options for survival for the Palestinians now
is gone. The other option, leaving, of course is sort of open&mdash;if
they can figure out some place to go. But with immigration
restrictions being what they are all over the world, that&rsquo;s
getting harder and harder.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Basically there&rsquo;s
nothing much left at all for the Palestinians. I mean, if Israel&rsquo;s
smart, what they&rsquo;ll do is transfer some production across the
border into the Territories, like the United States does with
Mexico&mdash;that would be smart from the Israeli industrialists&rsquo;
point of view. So instead of having to hire Jewish workers and giving
them wages and benefits and so on, they could just move a couple
miles across the border and get what the U.S. gets in Mexico or what
Germany gets in Bulgaria and so on: super-cheap labor  with no real
standards for working conditions, and basically no environmental
regulations. But there&rsquo;s so much racism in Israel that they&rsquo;re
not even considering what would at least be rational from an economic
point of view.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for the moment,
things are pretty much finished in the Territories&mdash;I mean, you
can&rsquo;t predict the future, but the point of the &ldquo;peace
process&rdquo; was to destroy the Palestinians, crush them,
demoralize them, eliminate them, ensure that the U.S. and Israel take
over everything. That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s all so admired here. And
none of this is likely to be affected by the elections&mdash;I mean,
why would it be? There may be some mild differences now with regard
to Israel&rsquo;s relationship with Syria, but that&rsquo;s about all
as far as I can see.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, the Labor Party
was looking for some sort of arrangement with Syria by which they
could maintain the Golan Heights&mdash;which remember is Syrian
territory that Israel conquered after the cease-fire in the Six Day
War in 1967, then drove out most of the population and took it over
and settled it. And it&rsquo;s a very important area, partly because
it has some agricultural wealth, but mainly because the Golan Heights
has a big influence on controlling the headwaters of the Jordan River
and other water sources, which are extremely important to Israel. So
Israel doesn&rsquo;t want to give up the Golan Heights, but Syria
won&rsquo;t make peace unless it formally regains control over
them&mdash;and it was likely that the Labor Party was going to try to
figure out some way of finessing an arrangement so that Syria could
have <i>legal</i> control of them, but Israel will retain <i>actual</i>
control, like maybe some 99-year lease or some deal like that that
the lawyers can figure out. The Labor Party was at least likely to
toy with arrangements like that, and maybe even begin to move towards
them; whether Syria would have accepted or not is an open question.
But now it&rsquo;s likely that Likud <i>won&rsquo;t</i> do that.
Apart from that, though, I don&rsquo;t really see much likelihood of
a difference in the international arrangements in the region as a
result of the recent election.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What I <i>do</i>
suspect will change are things internal to Israel&mdash;it&rsquo;s
only there that there&rsquo;s likely to be an effect. And that&rsquo;s
actually where the issues of the election were. In fact, if you look
at them for a minute, there&rsquo;s a real irony to these elections.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Netanyahu won a big
victory: the popular vote was split almost 50/50, but if you look at
the <i>Jewish</i> vote (which is the only part that counts as far as
policy-making goes in Israel), it was a far higher proportion, it was
over 55 percent&mdash;which is a landslide victory, you know.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">86</font></sup>
And that could have a major effect. See, the support for the Likud
Party was from several sources. They got close to 100 percent of the
religious vote&mdash;because there&rsquo;s a very big fundamentalist
religious community in Israel, and since it&rsquo;s a very
totalitarian community, they just do what the rabbis say, and the
rabbis said &ldquo;Vote for Likud.&rdquo; Then they also got a lot of
the sort of chauvinist nationalist Jewish vote. And actually they got
the vote of most of the working  class and the poor as well&mdash;because
the Labor Party in Israel, despite its name, is the party of the rich
elites and professionals and the Europeanized segments of the
population, and big business really likes it: I mean, they don&rsquo;t
mind Likud, but they really like Labor. In case you were confused
about this, the fact that the United States has supported the Labor
Party ought to be a giveaway about its real interests: the United
States does not support parties of working people and the poor.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is,
most of these voting blocks that joined to put Netanyahu in power
have a kind of religious chauvinist element to them&mdash;you know,
they want to restore and establish Jewish identity, their emphasis is
on what are called in the United States &ldquo;the cultural issues,&rdquo;
that&rsquo;s what Likud won on. And often that does have sort of a
populist appeal: so Likud got the support of poor and working people,
and they got it in the same kind of way as Pat Buchanan gets their
support here&mdash;and with about as much authenticity in terms of
concern for their interests. And part of the irony of the elections
is that the people these nationalist constituencies elected are
almost pure Americans and secular&mdash;I mean, Netanyahu could run
for office in the United States and nobody would notice it, he&rsquo;s
essentially an American, just listen to him on television. Or take
his leading foreign policy advisor, Dore Gold: he grew up in the
United States, has an American accent, he&rsquo;s completely
Americanized and secular&mdash;and he&rsquo;s the chief policy
advisor. So what in fact happened is that the most Americanized
element that has ever existed in Israeli politics won the election on
a nationalist/religious program. And since you&rsquo;ve got to give
some crumbs to your constituency, the question now is, how are they
going to do it? Well, <i>that&rsquo;s</i> the issue after the Israeli
elections.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And right now the
more secular European-types in the Israeli population are extremely
worried about it&mdash;and they&rsquo;re extremely worried about it
for the exact same reason we would be extremely worried about it if
the Christian Right turned out to be the major constituency of the
guy who wins the Presidential election in the United States. So
suppose Bob Dole had won the Presidency here in 1996 with the
overwhelming support of the Christian Right, and chauvinist fanatics,
and the &ldquo;militias,&rdquo; and so on and so forth. I mean, basic
policies wouldn&rsquo;t change much as a result, but something would
have to be done&mdash;there would have to be some kind of palliative
offer to the constituency that voted him in. And that can mean
things, it can have serious effects. So those are the sorts of
changes I think one can expect to see in Israel, and it&rsquo;s not
very clear how these internal factors will play out.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8726_2032848809"></a>P.L.O.
Ambitions<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Can you add
a word about the Palestinian leadership&rsquo;s response to the whole
&ldquo;peace process&rdquo;? You generally characterize the P.L.O. as
a bunch of conservative mayor-types&mdash;has that analysis changed
at all?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you know, I&rsquo;ve
always thought that the P.L.O. is the most corrupt and incompetent
Third World movement I&rsquo;ve ever seen.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">87</font></sup>
I mean, they&rsquo;ve <i>presented</i> themselves all these years as,
you know, revolutionaries waving around guns, Marx, etc.&mdash;but
they&rsquo;re basically conservative nationalists, and they always
<i>were</i> conservative nationalists: the rest was all pretense.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, part of the
reason for the failure of the whole Palestinian cause is that the
P.L.O. is the only Third World leadership I&rsquo;ve ever seen that
didn&rsquo;t try to stimulate or support&mdash;or even help&mdash;any
kind of international solidarity group. Even the North Koreans, crazy
as they are, have made efforts to try to get popular support in the
United States. But the Palestinian leadership never did. And it&rsquo;s
not because they weren&rsquo;t <i>told</i> that it would be a good
idea&mdash;I mean, there were people like, say, Ed Said
[Palestinian-American professor], who were trying to get them to do
that for years, and I was even involved in it myself. But they just
couldn&rsquo;t hear it. Their conception of the way politics works is
that it&rsquo;s arranged by rich guys sitting in back rooms who work
out deals together, and the population&rsquo;s irrelevant. They
haven&rsquo;t the slightest conception of the way a democratic system
functions. So while it&rsquo;s true we don&rsquo;t have like a
stellar democracy in the United States, what the population thinks
and does makes a difference here&mdash;a big difference&mdash;and
there are mechanisms to influence things. But the P.L.O. leadership
has just never understood that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The extent of this
is really astonishing, actually. Just to give you one example of it,
back in the early 1980s, when South End Press [a radical American
publishing collective] was first coming along, it was publishing some
books which could have been very useful for Palestinians. So one of
the books it published was a very good war diary about the 1982
Lebanon war, written by a well-known Israeli military officer who was
one of the founders of the Israeli army actually, a guy named Dov
Yermiya, who&rsquo;s a very respected guy and a decent human
being&mdash;and he was absolutely horrified by what was going on
during Israel&rsquo;s attack on Lebanon. So he wrote a war diary
which was published in Hebrew and was very different from anything
you ever heard here in the mainstream, giving an accurate picture of
what was going on, which was massive atrocities.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">88</font></sup>
Well, obviously no publisher in the United States was going to touch
it, but South End did publish it in English translation&mdash;and of
course, it never got reviewed, no library would pick it up, nobody
knows it exists, and so on; I had a book on the Middle East which was
the same story, and there were a couple others like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there was an
approach to the P.L.O. about all of this&mdash;and incidentally, the
P.L.O. had tons of money. I mean, part of their problem was that they
were way too rich for their own good: they had a ton of money because
the rich Arab states were trying to buy them off so they wouldn&rsquo;t
cause them any trouble. So you know, Arafat was able to broker
billion-dollar loans to Hungary, and all this kind of crazy business.
But anyway, the P.L.O. had tons of money, and there was a proposal to
try to get them just  to purchase books&mdash;like, say, Yermiya&rsquo;s
book&mdash;and send them to libraries so the book would be in
American public libraries: it was nothing more than that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, it got up to
the P.L.O. leadership, and they refused. Or rather, they would agree
to do it only if the book was published with a P.L.O. imprint on it,
saying, you know, &ldquo;Published with the support of the P.L.O.&rdquo;
Well, you can guess what it would mean if you published a book in the
United States with that imprint on it&mdash;so that was the end of
that idea. But just to do something like buying books which never
would be reviewed and putting them in libraries which aren&rsquo;t
going to buy them on their own, as a way to maybe help Palestinians
in refugee camps who are being smashed to pieces in Beirut [the
Lebanese city that was the focus of Israel&rsquo;s attack]&mdash;that
they wouldn&rsquo;t do. And in fact, that&rsquo;s just symbolic: they
would do <i>nothing</i> that would help to build up support for the
really suffering people who they were supposed to represent&mdash;just
because they were playing a different game. Their game was, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re
going to make a deal with Kissinger or Nixon, or some rich guy in a
back room, and then our problems will be over.&rdquo; Well, of course
that will never work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, the
corruption of the P.L.O. has just infuriated Palestinians in the
Territories, I should say. I was in the Territories back in 1988 or
so, and when you went into, say, the old city of Nablus, or villages,
and talked to organizers or activists, their hatred and contempt of
the P.L.O. was just extraordinary. They were very bitter about
it&mdash;about the robbery and the corruption and everything else&mdash;but
they just said: look, it&rsquo;s the best we&rsquo;ve got, that&rsquo;s
our international image, you want to talk diplomacy you&rsquo;ve got
to talk to them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">However, by about
1992 or &rsquo;93 even that kind of grudging acceptance had begun to
collapse. There was a lot of opposition to the Arafat leadership in
the Territories&mdash;and in the refugee camps in Lebanon, there were
open calls for his resignation, calls for democratizing the P.L.O.,
and so on. The Israeli press knew all about it&mdash;they cover the
Territories pretty well&mdash;and certainly Israeli intelligence knew
about it, because they&rsquo;ve got the place honeycombed. So there
were articles by doves in the Israeli press around the summer of 1993
or so, saying: now&rsquo;s a good time to deal with the P.L.O.,
because they&rsquo;re going to give away everything&mdash;since their
support is so weak inside the Occupied Territories, the last chance
the P.L.O. leadership has to hang on to power is to be our agents,
Israeli agents. Israeli <i>doves</i> wrote articles about that, and
of course the Israeli government knew it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">89</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, okay, that
whole phenomenon led to the Oslo Agreements&mdash;and now where the
P.L.O. leadership fits in is just as part of the standard Third World
model: they are the ruling Third World elite. So take a classic case,
look at the history of India for a couple hundred years under the
British Empire: the country was run by <i>Indians</i>, not by
British&mdash;the bureaucrats who actually ran things were Indians,
the soldiers who beat people up and smashed their heads were Indians.
There was an Indian leadership which became very rich and privileged
by being the agents of the British imperial  system&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
the same thing everywhere else. So for example, if you look at
Southern Africa in the more recent period, the most brutal atrocities
were carried out by black soldiers, who were basically mercenaries
for the white racist South African regime. And every Third World
country is like that. Whatever you want to call it, the whole
American sort of &ldquo;neocolonial system&rdquo;&mdash;El Salvador,
Brazil, the Philippines, and so on&mdash;is not run by <i>Americans.</i>
The U.S. may be in the background, and when things get out of hand
you may send in the American army or something&mdash;but basically
it&rsquo;s all being run by local agents of the imperial power, whose
internal power depends on their support from the outside, but who
very much enrich themselves by their client ruler status. Alright,
that&rsquo;s the standard colonial relationship, and the P.L.O. is
intending to play that role.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So they have a huge
security force&mdash;nobody really knows how big it is, because it&rsquo;s
secret, but they may have thirty or forty thousand men enlisted. They
surely have one of the highest densities of police per capita in the
world, if not the highest. They work very closely with the Israeli
secret services and the Israeli army. They&rsquo;re very brutal.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">90</font></sup>
And they&rsquo;re making a ton of money. So you go to places like
Gaza which are just collapsing, there are people starving in the
streets&mdash;and there&rsquo;s also a ton of construction, new fancy
restaurants, hotels, a lot of Palestinian investors going in and
making plenty of money: it&rsquo;s the standard Third World pattern,
that&rsquo;s the way the whole Third World is organized. And you see
it everywhere these days&mdash;Eastern Europe is becoming that way
too right now. I mean, about a year ago the per capita purchasing
rate of Mercedes-Benzes in Moscow was higher than it was in New York,
because there is tremendous wealth. Meanwhile, half a million more
people are dying every year in Russia than in the 1980s; mortality
for men has gone down seven or eight years on average in the last few
years; and on and on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">91</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, that&rsquo;s
the Third World. And that&rsquo;s the way the P.L.O. leadership sees
its future&mdash;and with some justice too, you know, because
otherwise they probably would have been kicked out. So now that&rsquo;s
their role, to oversee all of this, and they&rsquo;ll put up with any
humiliation, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what. I mean, you look at the
terms of the peace treaty, it was just gratuitous humiliation. But
the P.L.O. is perfectly happy to take it. And they&rsquo;ll get rich,
they&rsquo;ll have the guns, and they&rsquo;ll be the equivalent of
the elite in India, or Mexico, Thailand, Indonesia, or any other
place that you see in the Third World.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8728_2032848809"></a>The
Nation-State System<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, the
problems you describe in the world sound almost chronic to
me&mdash;systematic underdevelopment and exploitation in the Third
World, proliferation of nuclear weapons, the growing environmental
crisis. What means of social organization do you think would be
necessary for us to overcome these things?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, in my view
what would ultimately be necessary would be a breakdown of the
nation-state system&mdash;because I think that&rsquo;s not a viable
system. It&rsquo;s not necessarily the natural form of human
organization; in fact, it&rsquo;s a European invention pretty much.
The modern nation-state system basically developed in Europe since
the medieval period, and it was extremely difficult for it to
develop: Europe has a very bloody history, an extremely savage and
bloody history, with constant massive wars and so on, and that was
all part of an effort to establish the nation-state system. It has
virtually no relation to the way people live, or to their
associations, or anything else particularly, so it had to be
established by force. And it was established by centuries of bloody
warfare. That warfare ended in 1945&mdash;and the only reason it
ended is because the next war was going to destroy <i>everything.</i>
So it ended in 1945&mdash;we hope; if it didn&rsquo;t, it <i>will</i>
destroy everything.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The nation-state
system was exported to the rest of the world through European
colonization. Europeans were barbarians basically, savages: very
advanced technologically, and advanced in methods of warfare, but not
culturally or anything else particularly. And when they spread over
the rest of the world, it was like a plague&mdash;they just destroyed
everything in front of them, it was kind of like Genghis Khan or
something. They fought differently, they fought much more brutally,
they had better technology&mdash;and they essentially wiped
everything else out.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">92</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The American
continent&rsquo;s a good example. How come everybody around here has
a white face, and not a red face? Well, it&rsquo;s because the people
with the white faces were savages, and they killed the people with
red faces. When the British and other colonists came to this
continent, they simply destroyed everything&mdash;and pretty much the
same thing happened everywhere else in the world. You go back to
about the sixteenth century and the populations of Africa and Europe
were approximately comparable; a couple centuries later, the
population of Europe was far higher, maybe four times as high. Why
did that change? Well, you know, those were the effects of European
colonization.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">93</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the process of
colonization was extraordinarily destructive, and it in turn imposed
the European nation-state system on the world, kind of a reflection
of internal European society, which of course was always extremely
hierarchical and unequal and brutal. And if that system continues, I
suppose it will continue to be hierarchical and unequal and brutal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So I think <i>other</i>
forms of social organization have to be developed&mdash;and those
forms are not too difficult to imagine. I mean, the United Nations
was an attempt to do something about it, but it didn&rsquo;t work,
because the superpowers won&rsquo;t let it work. International law is
the same story. International law is a method by which you might
regulate the aggressive and destructive tendencies of the
nation-state&mdash;the trouble is, international law doesn&rsquo;t
have a police force: there are no Martians around to enforce it. So
international law will only work if the powers subjected to it are
willing to accept it, and the United States is not willing to accept
it. If the World Court condemns  us, we simply disregard it, it&rsquo;s
not our problem&mdash;we&rsquo;re above the law, we&rsquo;re a
lawless state.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">94</font></sup>
And as long as the major powers in the world are lawless and violent,
and are unwilling to enter into international arrangements or other
kinds of mechanisms which would constrain force and violence, there&rsquo;s
very little hope for human survival, I would think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, my own
feeling&mdash;I mean, big story&mdash;is that the reasons for all of
this have to do with the way that power is concentrated <i>inside</i>
the particular societies; that&rsquo;s the source of this extreme
violence in the world. Remember that every existing social system has
a vast disparity of power internally. Take the United States: the
United States was not founded on the principle that &ldquo;the
people&rdquo; ought to rule&mdash;that&rsquo;s freshman Civics, it&rsquo;s
not what happened in history. If you look back at the actual record,
you&rsquo;ll find that the principles of the American Founding
Fathers were quite different.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Keep in mind, all of
the Founding Fathers hated democracy&mdash;Thomas Jefferson was a
partial exception, but only partial. For the most part, they hated
democracy. The principles of the Founding Fathers were rather nicely
expressed by John Jay, the head of the Constitutional Convention and
the first Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. His favorite maxim was,
&ldquo;The people who own the country ought to govern it&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the principle on which the United States was founded.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">95</font></sup>
The major framer of the Constitution, James Madison, emphasized very
clearly in the debates at the Constitutional Convention in 1787 that
the whole system must be designed, as he put it, &ldquo;to protect
the minority of the opulent from the majority&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
the primary purpose of the government, he said.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">96</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, Madison had
kind of a theory behind that, which was that the &ldquo;minority of
the opulent&rdquo; would be elevated Enlightenment gentlemen, who
would act like some kind of ancient Roman republicans of his
imagination&mdash;benevolent philosophers who would use their
opulence to benefit everybody in the country. But he himself quickly
recognized that that was a serious delusion, and within about ten
years he was bitterly denouncing what he called the &ldquo;daring
depravity of the times&rdquo; as &ldquo;the minority of the opulent&rdquo;
were using their power to smash everyone else in the face.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, still in
the eighteenth century, Madison made some insightful comments about
the interactions between state power and private power. He said,
we&rsquo;ve designed a system in which the &ldquo;stock-jobbers&rdquo;
(what we would today call investors) are simply using state power for
their own ends&mdash;we thought we were going to create a system
which would put enlightened gentlemen in control so that they would
protect everyone from the tyranny of the majority, but instead what
we&rsquo;ve got is gangsters in control using state power for their
own benefit.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">97</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
the way the system was originally designed in the United States&mdash;and
over the next two centuries, that basic design hasn&rsquo;t changed a
lot. The &ldquo;minority of the opulent,&rdquo; who share a very
definite class interest, still have control of the government
institutions, both the parliament and the Executive, while the
general population remains highly dispersed, separated,  and as
Madison also recommended, fragmented so that people will not be able
to unite together to identify and press their interests.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">98</font></sup>
And the principle that &ldquo;The people who own the country ought to
govern it&rdquo; continues to be the dominant feature of American
politics.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, it&rsquo;s
not a very big secret who owns the country: you look at the <i>&ldquo;Fortune</i>
500&rdquo; every year and you figure out pretty well who owns the
country. The country is basically owned by a network of conglomerates
that control production and investment and banking and so on, and are
tightly inter-linked and very highly concentrated&mdash;<i>they</i>
own the country. And the principle of American democracy is that they
also ought to govern it. And to a very large extent, they do. Now,
whenever you have a concentration of power like that, you can be
certain that the people who <i>have</i> the power are going to try to
maximize it&mdash;and they&rsquo;re going to maximize it at the
expense of others, both in their own country and abroad. And that&rsquo;s
just an unviable system, I think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Let&rsquo;s put
international violence aside for a minute and take environmental
issues, which people are finally beginning to look at. Well, it&rsquo;s
been obvious for centuries that capitalism is going to self-destruct:
that&rsquo;s just inherent in the logic of system&mdash;because to
the extent that a system is capitalist, that means maximizing
short-term profit and not being concerned with long-term effects. In
fact, the motto of capitalism was, &ldquo;private vices, public
benefits&rdquo;&mdash;somehow it&rsquo;s gonna work out. Well, it
<i>doesn&rsquo;t</i> work out, and it&rsquo;s <i>never</i> going to
work out: if you&rsquo;re maximizing short-term profits without
concern for the long-term effects, you are going to destroy the
environment, for one thing. I mean, you can pretend up to a certain
point that the world has infinite resources and that it&rsquo;s an
infinite wastebasket&mdash;but at some point you&rsquo;re going to
run into the reality, which is that that isn&rsquo;t true.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, we&rsquo;re
running into that reality now&mdash;and it&rsquo;s very profound.
Take something like combustion: anything you burn, no matter what it
is, is increasing the greenhouse effect&mdash;and this was known to
scientists decades ago, they knew exactly what was happening.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">99</font></sup>
But in a capitalist system, you don&rsquo;t care about long-term
effects like that, what you have to care about is tomorrow&rsquo;s
profits. So the greenhouse effect has been building for years, and
there&rsquo;s no known technological fix on the horizon&mdash;there
may not be any answer to this, it could be so serious that there&rsquo;s
no remedy. That&rsquo;s possible, and then human beings will turn out
to have been a lethal mutation, which maybe destroys a lot of life
with us. Or it could be that there&rsquo;s some way of fixing it, or
some ameliorating way&mdash;nobody knows.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But just keep in
mind what we&rsquo;re dealing with: the predictable effect of an
increase in the world&rsquo;s temperature through the greenhouse
effect will be to raise the sea level, and if the sea level begins to
rise a few feet, it&rsquo;s not clear that human civilization can
continue. A lot of the agricultural lands, for example, are
alluvial&mdash;they&rsquo;re near the seas. Industrial centers, like
New York City, could be inundated. The climate is going to change, so
the agricultural-producing areas of the United States could become
dust-bowls.  And when these changes start to be recognized, they&rsquo;re
going to set into motion social conflict of a sort that we can&rsquo;t
even imagine&mdash;I mean, if it turns out that agricultural areas in
the United States are becoming unviable and that Siberia is becoming
the next great agricultural producer, do you think that American
planners are going to allow the Russians to use it? We&rsquo;ll
conquer it, even if we have to destroy the world in a nuclear war to
do it. That&rsquo;s the way they think, and have always thought. And
those conflicts are going to be growing up all over the world&mdash;you
can&rsquo;t even predict what they&rsquo;ll be like.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Alright, right now
we do not have the forms of internal democracy or international
organization which will allow us even to begin to cope with these
sorts of problems. The very concept of social planning, of rational
planning for human concerns&mdash;that&rsquo;s regarded as virtually
subversive. And that&rsquo;s the only thing that could possibly save
people: rational social planning, carried out by accountable people
representing the whole population rather than business elites.
Democracy, in other words&mdash;that&rsquo;s a concept we don&rsquo;t
have.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>Editors&rsquo;
Note: The 1992 movie Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the
Media was the most successful Canadian feature documentary ever made
and played in more than 32 countries. Although Chomsky cooperated
with the directors and liked them very much, he has not seen the film
and does not intend to, for reasons that follow.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">1</font></sup></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam,
watching your reactions to the documentary they made about your
critique of the media, you&rsquo;ve shown a lot of discomfort . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">You should see the
letters I write him [indicating Mark Achbar, one of the directors].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MARK ACHBAR: He&rsquo;s
a good letter-writer.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Again
earlier today you said something critical about it. I&rsquo;m sure
you realize the politically potent effect that the film is having.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Oh yes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: And I was
just wondering, if this were a film about Bertrand Russell [British
philosopher and socialist] and his powerful ideas, and how he helped
to change society with his ideas, would you be as critical of it, or
would you see it as a powerful political organizing tool?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">2</font></sup></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Both, both.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Then I guess
I&rsquo;d love to hear you say something positive about the film.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, what I would
say is exactly what you said&mdash;I mean, the positive impact of it
has been astonishing to me. Mark can give you the details, but
outside of the United States, the film is shown all over the place,
and even inside the United States it was shown to some extent.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: It was in a
lot of cities.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, but in every
other country it&rsquo;s been on national television.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: It came to
Seattle four times and sold out every screening.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, but everywhere
else it was on national television. I didn&rsquo;t realize this
myself until I was traveling around Europe giving talks last year,
and I&rsquo;d be in Finland and &ldquo;Oh yeah, we all saw it on
television&rdquo;&mdash;it was that sort of thing all over the place.
As a matter of fact, it&rsquo;s gotten to the point where I&rsquo;m
invited to film festivals all over the world&mdash;literally.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, one result of
that is there&rsquo;s been a ton of reviewing, and the reviewing is
extremely interesting. The reviews are often written just by guys who
write T.V. criticism for the newspapers, you know, completely
apolitical people. And their reaction is extremely positive, I&rsquo;d
say about 98 percent of the time it&rsquo;s <i>very</i> positive. In
fact, about the only thing that got a lot of people pissed off,
including Phil Donahue, was some remarks I made about sports: people
got kind of angry about that.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">3</font></sup>
But most of the time the reaction is very positive; they say, &ldquo;Yeah,
really interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, I get a ton
of letters about it&mdash;like I get a letter from some steel-worker
in Canada saying, &ldquo;I took my friends three times, we all saw it
and it&rsquo;s great,&rdquo; and so on and so forth. Well, that&rsquo;s
all fine. But the standard letter, the <i>standard</i> letter, is
something like this: it says, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m really glad they made
this film; I thought I was the only person in the world who had these
thoughts, I&rsquo;m delighted to know that somebody else actually has
them and is saying them.&rdquo; Then comes the punch-line: &ldquo;How
can I join your movement?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m
ambivalent.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, I don&rsquo;t
think it&rsquo;s anything Mark and Peter [the directors] did wrong; I
mean, I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie, but I know that they were very
well aware of this problem, and tried very hard to overcome it. But
somehow it&rsquo;s just inherent in the medium, I don&rsquo;t think
the medium allows an escape from this&mdash;or if it does, I don&rsquo;t
think that anybody&rsquo;s yet found it. I mean, I don&rsquo;t think
the medium can make people understand that if they film me giving a
talk somewhere, that&rsquo;s because somebody else <i>organized</i>
the talk, and the real work is being done by the people who organized
the talk, and then followed it up and are out there working in their
communities. If they can bring in some speaker to help get people
together, terrific,  but that person is in no sense &ldquo;the
leader.&rdquo; That somehow doesn&rsquo;t get across in a movie&mdash;what
gets across is, &ldquo;How can I join your movement?&rdquo; And then
I&rsquo;ve got to write a letter which is a big speech about this. So
I am ambivalent about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Incidentally, one
more comment about the reviews: the reviews in the United States were
intriguingly different. First of all, there weren&rsquo;t many,
because it wasn&rsquo;t shown a lot here. But they were very
interesting. Do you remember the <i>New York Times</i> review? That
was really fascinating, that was the most intriguing one.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MARK ACHBAR: They
left your name out of the title of the film.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, yeah, right.
But actually, the <i>New York Times</i> to my surprise wrote a very
favorable review, or what I&rsquo;m sure they took to be a favorable
review. They assigned it to Vincent Canby, who&rsquo;s kind of an
old-time New Dealer, he was the big cultural critic at the <i>Times</i>
forever, and he wrote a review which I&rsquo;m sure everybody at the
<i>Times</i> took to be very favorable. It said something like, oh
yeah, really interesting guy, wonderful film, so on and so forth.
Then it said, obviously there&rsquo;s nothing to what he&rsquo;s
saying, of course it&rsquo;s all nonsense&mdash;but it was very
sympathetic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Then it got really
interesting. It said, though what he&rsquo;s saying is all nonsense,
nevertheless the leading idea is worth taking seriously, even though
it sounds crazy. And the leading idea, Canby said, is that the
government is only responsive to the fifty percent of the population
who vote, not to the fifty percent who don&rsquo;t vote, so therefore
we ought to try to register more people. He said, yeah, this sounds
pretty far out in left field, but nevertheless we shouldn&rsquo;t
discount it totally, something like that.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">4</font></sup>
It just flew by him completely&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t see what the
film was about. I mean, the most illiterate T.V. reviewer in Tasmania
didn&rsquo;t miss the point like that, it&rsquo;s only in the <i>United
States</i> that it has to be completely missed. And that&rsquo;s what
it means to &ldquo;think properly.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But I do think the
film is double-edged. It&rsquo;s certainly energized a lot of
activism. I think it did a tremendous amount of good just for East
Timor alone [the film includes extensive coverage of the unreported
East Timor genocide as a case study of Edward Herman&rsquo;s and
Chomsky&rsquo;s &ldquo;Propaganda Model&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">5</font></sup>].
And it&rsquo;s had a good impact in other respects. But it also has
this negative aspect, which seems to me almost unavoidable. But you
wanted to say something more . . .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MARK ACHBAR: I&rsquo;m
sure you&rsquo;re aware that we have you saying in the film, almost
verbatim, what you just said: that the reason you can give talks all
over the place is because people are organizing.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, I know&mdash;but
it just doesn&rsquo;t get across. There&rsquo;s something about the
medium which prevents it from getting across. I mean, I know that it
was tried, I know that that was the idea, but . . .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MARK ACHBAR: Was
it really the majority of letters that said, &ldquo;I want to join
your movement&rdquo;?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, they say
something like that: the general picture is that it&rsquo;s about
<i>me</i>&mdash;and it isn&rsquo;t. The whole point is, it&rsquo;s
not. And I don&rsquo;t know how you get that across to people in a
film.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But it is
about you, just the ideas aren&rsquo;t about you.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Nooo!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: The ideas
are for the world to think about.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But see, it really
<i>isn&rsquo;t</i>&mdash;because if I&rsquo;m somewhere giving a
talk, it&rsquo;s precisely because somebody organized a meeting.
Like, I&rsquo;m here, but I didn&rsquo;t do anything&mdash;Mike and
Lydia [Albert and Sargent, co-editors of <i>Z Magazine</i> ] did
something. I didn&rsquo;t do anything. And that&rsquo;s the way it is
everywhere else too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But you&rsquo;re
also here because of the way you grew up, and that school that you
went to.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the same is true
of everybody else who&rsquo;s here too. Yeah, sure. Everybody&rsquo;s
got their own story.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: But the
critique of the media in the film is taken from speeches that you
gave.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, but that&rsquo;s
because other people are doing important things and I&rsquo;m not
doing important things&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it literally comes
down to. I mean, years ago I used to be involved in organizing
too&mdash;I&rsquo;d go to meetings, get involved in resistance, go to
jail, all of that stuff&mdash;and I was just no good at it at all;
some of these people here can tell you. So sort of a division of
labor developed: I decided to do what I&rsquo;m doing now, and other
people kept doing the other things. Friends of mine who were
basically the same as me&mdash;went to the same colleges and graduate
schools, won the same prizes, teach at M.I.T. and so on&mdash;just
went a different way. They spend their time organizing, which is much
more important work&mdash;so they&rsquo;re not in a film. That&rsquo;s
what the difference is. I mean, I do something basically less
important&mdash;it <i>is</i>, in fact. It&rsquo;s adding something,
and I can do it, so I do it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t have any false
modesty about it. And it&rsquo;s helpful. But it&rsquo;s helpful to
people who are doing the real work. And every popular movement I know
of in history has been like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, it&rsquo;s
extremely important for people with power not to let anybody
understand this, to make them think there are big leaders around who
somehow get things going, and then what everybody else has to do is
follow  them. That&rsquo;s one of the ways of demeaning people, and
degrading them, and making them passive. I don&rsquo;t know how to
overcome this exactly, but it&rsquo;s really something people ought
to work on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: As an
activist for East Timor, though, I have to say that the film put our
work on a completely different level. Even if you have some trouble
with it personally, it has gotten people doing a lot of real work out
there.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think that&rsquo;s
true; I know that&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>ANOTHER WOMAN:
Now I&rsquo;ve got to admit it&mdash;I felt odd having you sign a
book for my friend earlier today.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, it&rsquo;s
crazy&mdash;it&rsquo;s just completely wrong. In a place like San
Francisco, it gets embarrassing: I can&rsquo;t walk across the
Berkeley campus&mdash;literally&mdash;without twenty people coming up
and asking me to sign something. That doesn&rsquo;t make any sense.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: It does
feel unnatural.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It is, it&rsquo;s
completely missing the point. It&rsquo;s simply not factually
accurate, for one thing&mdash;because like I say, the real work is
being done by people who are not known, that&rsquo;s always been true
in every popular movement in history. The people who are known are
riding the crest of some wave. Now, you can ride the crest of the
wave and try to use it to get power, which is the standard thing, or
you can ride the crest of the wave because you&rsquo;re helping
people that way, which is another thing. But the point is, it&rsquo;s
the wave that matters&mdash;and that&rsquo;s what people ought to
understand. I don&rsquo;t know how you get that across in a film.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, come to
think of it, there are some films that have done it. I mean, I don&rsquo;t
see a lot of visual stuff, so I&rsquo;m not the best commentator, but
I thought <i>Salt of the Earth</i> really did it. It was a long time
ago, but at the time I thought that it was one of the really great
movies&mdash;and of course it was killed, I think it was almost never
shown.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Which one
was that?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>Salt of the
Earth.</i> It came out at the same time as <i>On the Waterfront</i>,
which is a rotten movie. And <i>On the Waterfront</i> became a huge
hit&mdash;because it was anti-union. See, <i>On the Waterfront</i>
was part of a big campaign to destroy unions while pretending to be
for, you know, Joe Sixpack. So <i>On the Waterfront</i> is about this
Marlon Brando or somebody who stands up for the poor working man
against the corrupt union boss. Okay, things like that exist, but
that&rsquo;s not unions&mdash;I mean, sure, there are plenty of union
bosses who are crooked, but nowhere near as many as C.E.O.s who are
crooked, or what have you. But since <i>On the Waterfront</i>
combined that anti-union message with &ldquo;standing up for the poor
working man,&rdquo; it became a huge hit. On the other hand, <i>Salt
of the Earth</i>, which was an authentic and I thought very well-done
story about a strike and the people involved in it, that was just
flat killed, I don&rsquo;t even think it was shown anywhere. I mean,
you could see it at an art theater, I guess, but that was about it. I
don&rsquo;t know what those of you who know something about film
would think of it, but I thought it was a really outstanding film.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8732_2032848809"></a>Media
Activism<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, I
agree with you that alternative media activists have to be very
careful not to re-create authoritarian structures like the ones that
exist now&mdash;like, not have a &ldquo;Z Channel&rdquo; [i.e. after
Z Magazine] that goes about things in the same way as A.B.C. and
C.B.S. But I&rsquo;m not quite sure how we can disseminate
information effectively and still be egalitarian as we do it: it
seems to me there is this tendency to try to speak from a position of
authority, and we really have to fight against that.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think that&rsquo;s
exactly right&mdash;that&rsquo;s a crucial point. I don&rsquo;t
completely know what the answer is to that, actually&mdash;I&rsquo;d
be interested in what some of you have to say about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Well, let&rsquo;s
just take you personally for a second. When people ask you where to
turn for more truth and for accuracy of information, what do you tell
them?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What I usually say
is that they&rsquo;re not phrasing the question the right way. I
mean, people should not be asking me or anyone else where to turn for
an accurate picture of things: they should be asking <i>themselves</i>
that. So someone can ask me what reflects my interpretation of the
way things are, and I can tell them where they can get material that
looks at the world the way I think it ought to be looked at&mdash;but
then <i>they</i> have to decide whether or not that&rsquo;s accurate.
Ultimately it&rsquo;s your own mind that has to be the arbiter:
you&rsquo;ve got to rely on your own common sense and intelligence,
you can&rsquo;t rely on anyone else for the truth.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the answer I give
is, I think the smartest thing to do is to read everything you
read&mdash;and that includes what I write, I would always tell people
this&mdash;skeptically. And in fact, an honest writer will try to
make it clear what his or her biases are and where the work is
starting from, so that then readers can compensate&mdash;they can
say, &ldquo;This person&rsquo;s coming from over here, and that&rsquo;s
the way she&rsquo;s looking at the world, now I can correct for what
may well be her bias; I can decide for myself whether what she&rsquo;s
telling me is accurate, because at least she&rsquo;s making her
premises clear.&rdquo; And people  <i>should</i> do that. You should
start by being very skeptical about anything that comes to you from
any sort of power system&mdash;and about everything else too. You
should be skeptical about what I tell you&mdash;why should you
believe a word of it? I got my own ax to grind. So figure it out for
yourself. There really is no other answer.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And in fact, if
you&rsquo;re an organizer who&rsquo;s serious about it, what you&rsquo;re
going to try to do is help people <i>themselves</i> find their own
answers. And then if you can be a resource, or point them in some
direction that might be useful, or help put them in touch with
somebody, or take care of their kids while they&rsquo;re out looking
for a job or something&mdash;okay, that&rsquo;s organizing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MARK ACHBAR:
Noam, one of the best things you said that didn&rsquo;t end up in the
film was, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so much a matter of what you read,
it&rsquo;s a matter of how you read.&rdquo; When people ask me about
sources for information, I recommend the New York Times as quickly as
I recommend Z Magazine.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, I do too&mdash;I
absolutely agree with that. Take, say, <i>Business Week</i>: it&rsquo;s
useful to read it, it&rsquo;s useful to read what the ruling class
tells its people. You can learn an awful lot from the <i>Wall Street
Journal</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> and so on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, I think in
general that people tend not to read the business press as much as
they should. Most of it is very boring, but there are things in there
that you do not find elsewhere&mdash;they tend to be more honest,
because they&rsquo;re talking to people they don&rsquo;t have to be
worried about, and to people who need to know the truth so that they
can go out and make decisions about their money. I mean, you can lie
as much as you want in the <i>Boston Globe</i> or something, but the
people who read the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> have to have a
tolerable sense of reality when they go out to make money. So in
journals like <i>Business Week</i> and <i>Fortune</i>, you&rsquo;ll
typically find an awful lot of very useful information. These are
journals that you shouldn&rsquo;t <i>buy,</i> incidentally, they&rsquo;re
too expensive; but you should steal them if you can. They&rsquo;re
also in the library.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">6</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As a more general
matter, though, if you really want to educate yourself politically,
what you have to do is become part of a group&mdash;because unless
you&rsquo;re a real fanatic about it, you&rsquo;re just not going to
be able to do it all by yourself. I mean, <i>I</i> do it, but I know
I&rsquo;ve got a screw loose, and I don&rsquo;t expect anybody else
to be that crazy. On the other hand, a group working together can do
it very well. Take a look at the Central America solidarity movements
in the 1980s, for example&mdash;they were usually church-based groups
around the country, and they just kept working at it together. They
had people going down there, they had their own literature, they
circulated information around, and the result was, there were people
I met in those groups who knew more about Central America than I
do&mdash;and I work on it hard. They certainly knew more about it
than the C.I.A., which is no big thing actually, or than people in a
lot of the academic departments. But that&rsquo;s what can  happen
when you start working together&mdash;and I think that&rsquo;s just
got to be the answer, except for a few crazed individuals here and
there.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And in fact, what I
just said about my own work isn&rsquo;t really accurate&mdash;because
I certainly don&rsquo;t find all the information I use on my own. The
fact is, there are a lot of people around the world who are in a
similar position, and we share information together. A good deal of
my time is actually spent just clipping newspapers and periodicals
and professional journals, and photocopying them to send to
people&mdash;and they do the same for me. And the result is, I can
easily get to know more than people in the C.I.A., or in any academic
research center&mdash;mainly because I have smart agents, not dumb
agents, and they know what&rsquo;s important and can dig things out.
I mean, mainstream scholars and national intelligence agencies don&rsquo;t
have very smart and perceptive people scanning the journals and the
press in other countries and around the United States, and finding
what&rsquo;s important, doing an analysis of it and sending it to
them. The countries I&rsquo;m especially interested in, like say
Israel, I could never cover the press well enough by myself, it&rsquo;s
just too much of a job. But if I have friends there clipping it and
sending me articles, and picking out what&rsquo;s important, we can
share understanding. And it&rsquo;s the same with other places&mdash;for
instance, a lot of the work I&rsquo;ve done on Southeast Asia and
East Timor has used mostly material from the Australian press: I just
get tons of stuff from there.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And again, it&rsquo;s
reciprocal: you do this for a number of people, they do it for you,
and the end result is, informal networks of cooperation develop
through which people can pool their efforts and compensate for a lack
of resources. That&rsquo;s exactly what organization is all <i>about</i>,
in fact.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, I
remember in the movie you criticized the U.S. media for insisting on
&ldquo;concision&rdquo;&mdash;restricting news analysis to concise
sound-bites, so only conventional wisdom can be presented coherently.
But in the organizing I&rsquo;ve done, I&rsquo;ve found that it&rsquo;s
important to use both &ldquo;concision&rdquo; and a more in-depth
type of analysis, to use the two in combination. I&rsquo;m thinking
specifically of trying to get people&rsquo;s attention through
fact-sheets and quick blurbs of information that you can digest
easily, and then go on to find out more. I&rsquo;m wondering what you
think about that kind of combined use?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sure, oh yeah&mdash;it&rsquo;s
very useful to do it that way. Actually, I should say that this term
&ldquo;concision&rdquo; is kind of like a joke&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
word I learned from the media P.R. guys when I heard one of them use
it, I forget who . . .</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MARK ACHBAR: Jeff

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Producer at
<i>Nightline</i> or something. He used the word &ldquo;concision&rdquo;
to describe what they do&mdash;you know, find people who can make
their points in 600 words, or between two commercials.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">7</font></sup>
It was the first time I&rsquo;d ever heard the term. But yeah, it&rsquo;s
around, and it&rsquo;s a technique of thought control. But you can
use it quite constructively too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For example, during
the Gulf War, <i>Z Magazine</i> ran a couple pages of just short
factual statements of what the basic story was&mdash;I think every
good organizing group does things like that. I mean, people need to
have information in the front of their minds, so that they know what
the general structure is&mdash;it&rsquo;s just that then you should
fill in the depth. So I think you should use the techniques in
combination: there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with slogans if they lead
you to something. But of course, we should also be making people
aware that <i>any</i> presentation of facts is a selection and an
interpretation&mdash;I mean, we&rsquo;re picking the facts that <i>we</i>
think are important, maybe they&rsquo;ll think something else is
important.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: A common
response when you give people a fact-sheet is, &ldquo;Why should we
trust you? Where did you get this information?&rdquo; Not enough
people ask those questions, actually.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">They should, yeah.
But that distrust still is something that&rsquo;s very hard to
overcome as an organizer. I don&rsquo;t know how many of you have
been following the <i>Z</i> online Bulletin Board lately [a computer
network discussion forum], but there&rsquo;s been an ongoing
conversation there in which people have pointed out&mdash;and they&rsquo;re
right, I don&rsquo;t know any answer to it&mdash;that they&rsquo;ll
come to people with, not necessarily just fact-sheets, but even
detailed, elaborate arguments with a lot of evidence and data, but
it&rsquo;s different from what everyone has always heard, and the
standard response is, &ldquo;Well, why should I believe you?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And that&rsquo;s not
an unreasonable response. I mean, if somebody came to you with a
three-volume work with a lot of footnotes and statistics and
mathematical calculations which proved that the world is flat, you&rsquo;d
be very wise to be cautious, no matter how impressive it looked. And
that&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;re coming to people most of the
time&mdash;we&rsquo;re telling them that the world is flat, and
they&rsquo;re not going to believe all your evidence. They <i>should</i>,
in fact, ask questions like that. And that&rsquo;s just a hard
situation for organizers to overcome: you only really overcome that
by winning confidence, and helping people gain a broader
understanding for themselves, bit by bit.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8734_2032848809"></a>Self-Destruction
of the U.S. Left<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You travel
around the country doing a lot of speaking engagements, Noam. I&rsquo;m
wondering, just from going to all these different communities, what
do you think things look like in general as far as the movement goes,
as far as politics go&mdash;what&rsquo;s your assessment?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, over the years
I think there&rsquo;s sort of like a tendency you can see&mdash;a
tendency towards, on the one hand, much larger groups of people
getting engaged in political activism in some fashion, or at least
<i>wanting</i> to become involved in some sort of progressive
activity, roughly speaking. On the other hand, the opportunities for
it are declining at the same time&mdash;and people are becoming
extremely isolated. I just got a sense of it yesterday afternoon. I
was getting ready to go off for a couple of weeks, so I did my
monthly making out of checks to all the, you know, worthwhile
organizations around the world. And it&rsquo;s amazing when you see
it. You take any topic you like, no matter how narrow it is&mdash;I
mean, health rights in the southern part of Guatemala, let&rsquo;s
say&mdash;and there are fifteen separate organizations working on it,
maybe right next door to one another, so you have to make out fifteen
checks.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
what I happened to notice yesterday, but it&rsquo;s characteristic of
what&rsquo;s happening: everybody&rsquo;s got their own little
operation, everything is extremely narrowly focused and very small,
and often the groups don&rsquo;t even know about each other&rsquo;s
existence. And partly that&rsquo;s the result of, and partly it
contributes to, a sense of real isolation, and also a kind of
hopelessness&mdash;a sense that nothing&rsquo;s going on, because
after all it&rsquo;s just me and my three friends. And it&rsquo;s
true, it&rsquo;s you and your three friends, except down the block
there&rsquo;s somebody else and their three friends. The success in
atomizing the population has been extraordinary; I think that&rsquo;s
in fact the major propaganda achievement of recent years&mdash;just
to isolate people in a most astonishing fashion. And the left has
done a lot to help that along, in my opinion.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So what you find all
around the country is huge mobs of people showing up at talks and
wanting to get involved, but nobody around with anything for them to
do, or any sense that there could be any follow-up. I mean, the
standard question after a talk where thousands of people have shown
up is, &ldquo;What can I do?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a terrible
condemnation of the left, that people have to ask that question.
There ought to be fifty booths outside with people saying, &ldquo;Look,
join up, here&rsquo;s what you can do.&rdquo; And there aren&rsquo;t&mdash;or
if there are, the groups are so narrow that people just have a
feeling, &ldquo;Look, I don&rsquo;t want to do anything this narrow;
I mean, I&rsquo;m all in favor of gay and lesbian rights in Western
Massachusetts, say, but I don&rsquo;t want to devote my whole life to
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: What
exactly has the left done that you think is so self-destructive?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In part the problem
is just divisiveness&mdash;it&rsquo;s passionate commitment to a very
narrow position, and extreme intolerance of anyone who doesn&rsquo;t
see it  exactly the way you do. So if you have a slightly different
view from the person next door on, say, abortion rights, it&rsquo;s a
war&mdash;you can&rsquo;t even talk to each other, it&rsquo;s not an
issue that you can even discuss. There&rsquo;s a lot of that on the
left, and it&rsquo;s been very self-destructive. It&rsquo;s made the
progressive movements, the sort of &ldquo;left&rdquo; movements, kind
of unwelcome&mdash;because people don&rsquo;t like it; they see it,
and they don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, there&rsquo;s
just a huge amount of frittering away of energy on real absurdities.
There are parts of the country, like California, where <i>incredible</i>
amounts of energy go into things like trying to figure out exactly
which Mafia figure might have been involved in killing John F.
Kennedy or something&mdash;as if anybody should care. The energy and
the passion that goes into things like that is really extraordinary,
and it&rsquo;s very self-destructive.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take a look at
the intellectual left, the people who ought to be involved in the
kinds of things we&rsquo;re doing here. If you look at the academic
left, say, it&rsquo;s mired in intricate, unintelligible discourse of
some crazed post-modernist variety, which nobody can understand,
including the people who are involved in it&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
really good for careers and that sort of thing. That again pulls a
ton of energy into activities which have the great value that they
are guaranteed not to affect anything in the world, so therefore
they&rsquo;re very useful for the institutions to support and to
tolerate and to encourage people to get involved with.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another thing is,
there are just extreme illusions about what&rsquo;s going on in the
world&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the fault of all of us, in fact: we just
can&rsquo;t seem to get over them. Take the so-called &ldquo;Gulf
War&rdquo;&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t really a war, it was a slaughter,
but take the Gulf Slaughter. It led to tremendous depression on the
left, because people felt like they weren&rsquo;t able to do anything
about it. Well, if you just think about it for a minute, you realize
that it was exactly the opposite: it was probably the greatest
victory the peace movement has ever had. The Gulf War was the first
time in history that there were huge demonstrations and protests
<i>before</i> a war started&mdash;that&rsquo;s never happened before.
In the case of the Vietnam War, it was five years before anybody got
out in the streets; this time, there were massive demonstrations with
hundreds of thousands of people involved <i>before</i> the bombing
even started. And if you just look at the attitudes of the general
population, up until the day the bombing started it was about two to
one in favor of a negotiated settlement involving Iraqi withdrawal
from Kuwait in the context of an international conference on regional
issues, Israel-Palestine issues and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">8</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, at the time,
the left couldn&rsquo;t do anything about it. First of all, it didn&rsquo;t
know it, and didn&rsquo;t know that there were alternatives&mdash;like
it didn&rsquo;t know that a week earlier high U.S. officials had
rejected an Iraqi offer to withdraw from Kuwait on exactly those
terms.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">9</font></sup> But
nevertheless, there is a huge reservoir of support in the general
population&mdash;it&rsquo;s just the left isn&rsquo;t dealing with
it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, the
attitudes of the general population are absolutely astonishing. For
example, 83 percent of the American population thinks that the
economic system is inherently unfair, &ldquo;the rich get richer and
the poor get poorer&rdquo;&mdash;meaning things should just be
radically changed.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">10</font></sup>
Well, what is the left doing about that mere 83 percent of the
population that thinks everything has to be radically changed? What
we&rsquo;re doing is alienating them, or making them feel that we
have nothing to say to them, or something like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or I remember in
1987, when there was a big hoopla about the bicentennial of the
Constitution, the <i>Boston Globe</i> published one of my favorite
polls, in which they gave people little slogans and said, &ldquo;Guess
which ones are in the Constitution.&rdquo; Of course, nobody knows
what&rsquo;s in the Constitution, because everybody forgot what they
learned in third grade, and probably they didn&rsquo;t pay any
attention to it then anyway&mdash;so what the question really was
asking is, &ldquo;What is such an obvious truism that it must be in
the Constitution?&rdquo; Well, one of the suggestions was, &ldquo;What
about &lsquo;From each according to his ability, to each according to
his needs&rsquo;?&rdquo; [a slogan from Karl Marx]. Half the American
population thinks that&rsquo;s in the Constitution, because it&rsquo;s
such an obvious truth&mdash;it&rsquo;s so obviously true that it must
be in the Constitution, where else could it come from?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">11</font></sup>
If you think about what this means and what we&rsquo;re doing about
it, it&rsquo;s mind-boggling, the chasm.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take the whole
Ross Perot phenomenon during the 1992 election [Perot is an American
billionaire who ran for President on an independent ticket]. Ross
Perot appeared on the political scene and had no program, nobody knew
what he stood for, he could have come from Mars for all anybody knew,
and within a couple days he was running even with the two major
candidates. I mean, if a puppet was running it probably would have
come out even.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or do you remember
the whole business with Dan Quayle and Murphy Brown? That was taken
very seriously in the United States, it was treated as if these were
two real people&mdash;a debate between the Vice President and a
television actress; actually, not an actress, a character on a
television show, who then responded through the show [Quayle had
criticized the character for deciding to have a child out of
wedlock]. Well, there was a poll done at that time in which people
were asked who they would prefer as President, Dan Quayle or Murphy
Brown&mdash;and you can guess who won.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">12</font></sup>
There wasn&rsquo;t a poll done as to who they thought was real; I&rsquo;m
not sure what the result of that one would have been.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But what these
things demonstrate is something that is shown over and over again in
careful public opinion studies: the population is what&rsquo;s called
&ldquo;alienated.&rdquo; People think that none of the institutions
work for them, everything&rsquo;s a scam, a crooked operation; they
feel they have no way of influencing anything, the political system
doesn&rsquo;t work, the economic system doesn&rsquo;t work,
everything is being done somewhere else and it&rsquo;s all out of
their control. And this feeling goes up across the board pretty
regularly.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">13</font></sup>
I mean, they&rsquo;re not aware how much it&rsquo;s true&mdash;like,
they&rsquo;re not aware that in the current G.A.T.T. [General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] negotiations,  major decisions are
being made that will have a tremendous impact on the world and on
their lives, and neither they, nor the unions, nor Congress knows
anything about them. But they get a sense of it, they sort of have a
feel for it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the point is,
the left is doing virtually nothing to try to take advantage of this
situation and turn the tremendous discontentedness in some kind of
constructive direction. What I see on the left at least is pretty
much the same story everywhere: tremendous divisiveness, narrowness
of focus, intolerance, unwillingness to meet people on their own
terms, plus inertia, and just madness of various kinds.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the reason for a
lot of that is&mdash;well, I think you could sort of see some of the
reasons. If you just take the Civil Rights Movement and look at its
course, I think you get a pretty good idea of some of the reasons. In
the early part of the Civil Rights Movement, in the late 1950s and
early Sixties, there was tremendous courage and dedication, and huge
numbers of people finally got involved, including all the way up to
middle-class America. And it was successful: there were big victories
in the South. And then somehow it stopped. Well, what happened? What
happened was, you got restaurants integrated, and you got things like
the Voting Rights Act of 1965&mdash;it was a little bit like what&rsquo;s
going on in South Africa now, although there it&rsquo;s much more
dramatic. And you were able to establish the forms that in general
are accepted by the mainstream Establishment culture, and even by the
business community&mdash;like, General Motors doesn&rsquo;t have any
stake in having restaurants segregated, in fact they&rsquo;d rather
have them not segregated, it&rsquo;s more efficient. So all of that
stuff worked, at least to a certain extent. It wasn&rsquo;t easy&mdash;a
lot of people got killed, it was very brutal and so on. But it
worked. And then it stopped, and it frittered away, and in fact
probably it&rsquo;s regressed since then. And the reason is, it ran
into class issues&mdash;and they&rsquo;re hard. They require
institutional change. There the Board of Directors of General Motors
is <i>not</i> going to be happy, when you start dealing with class
issues in the industrial centers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So at that point it
stopped, and it frittered away, and also it went off into pretty
self-destructive things&mdash;revolutionary slogans, carrying guns
around, smashing windows, this and that&mdash;just because it ran
into harder issues. And when you run into harder issues, it&rsquo;s
easy to look for an escape. And there are a lot of different escapes.
You can escape by writing meaningless articles on some unintelligible
version of academic radical feminism, or by becoming a conspiracy
buff, or by working on some very narrowly focused issue, which may be
important, but is so narrow that it&rsquo;s never going to get
anywhere or have any outreach. There are a lot of these temptations.
And as the number of people becoming interested and involved has
increased, since the issues are indeed hard, they&rsquo;re not easy,
there&rsquo;s been a kind of chasm developing between the
potentialities and the actual achievements.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: You don&rsquo;t
think the left is dealing with class issues?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Not much. I mean,
it&rsquo;s not that nobody is. And they&rsquo;re not the only issues
that have to be dealt with, it&rsquo;s just that they&rsquo;re the
most important ones&mdash;because they&rsquo;re right at the core of
the whole system of oppression. And also, they&rsquo;re the hardest
ones, because there you&rsquo;re dealing with solid institutional
structures where the core of private power is involved. I mean, other
issues are hard too&mdash;like issues of patriarchy are hard. But
they&rsquo;re modifiable without changing the whole system of power.
Class issues aren&rsquo;t.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Do you have
any strategies for the left to be able to get more on common ground
with the working class?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, first of all,
&ldquo;working class&rdquo; is pretty broad. I mean, anybody who gets
a paycheck is in some sense &ldquo;working class,&rdquo; so there&rsquo;s
a sense in which a lot of managers are working class too&mdash;and in
fact, they have pretty much the same interests these days: they&rsquo;re
getting canned as fast as everybody else is, and they&rsquo;re
worried about it. See, in the United States the word &ldquo;class&rdquo;
is used in an unusual way: it&rsquo;s supposed to have something to
do with wealth. But in its traditional usage, and the way the word is
used everywhere else, what it has to do with is your place in the
whole system of decision-making and authority&mdash;so if you take
orders, you&rsquo;re &ldquo;working class,&rdquo; even if you&rsquo;re
wealthy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And how should the
left be dealing with class issues? Well, we have to take that 83
percent of the population that thinks that the system is inherently
unfair, and increase it to a larger percentage, then we simply help
people get organized to change it. There are no special tactics for
that, it&rsquo;s just the usual education and organizing. Okay, so
you get started doing it.</p>

</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: One thing
that I&rsquo;ve noticed in reading a number of your books, and a
number of books by people like Holly Sklar and Michael Albert, is
that it&rsquo;s a standard practice on the left in trying to help
educate people&mdash;because we are in the minority position&mdash;to
document everything very thoroughly, to lay out very precise
scholarly arguments, to marshal a lot of evidence and have a ton of
citations. But the thing that bothers me about that is there are a
lot of people who are shut out of that world.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: They&rsquo;re
not academics, they haven&rsquo;t been trained in this way of making
arguments. I really wish that there was something out there in the
making arguments. I really wish that there was something out there in
the middle ground that would not just try to persuade, but would also
teach about argumentation. Somebody told me they used to do things
like that in the 1930s, with popular education.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Absolutely&mdash;in
fact, that was one of the big things in the 1930s for left
intellectuals to be involved in. I mean, good scientists, well-known,
important scientists like Bernal [British physicist] and others just
felt that it was a part of their obligation to the human species to
do popular science. So you had very good popular books being written
about physics, and about mathematics and so on&mdash;for instance,
there&rsquo;s a book called <i>Mathematics for the Million</i> which
is an example of it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">14</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Yeah, I&rsquo;ve
heard of that.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that guy came
out of the left. And the point is, those people just felt that this
kind of knowledge should be shared by everyone. In fact, one of the
things I find most astonishing about the current left-intellectual
scene is that what the counterparts of these people today are telling
the general public is, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to know about this
stuff, it&rsquo;s all just some white male power-play&mdash;and
besides, astrology&rsquo;s the same as physics: it&rsquo;s all just a
discourse, and a text, and this that and the other thing, so forget
about it, do what comes natural; if you like astrology, it&rsquo;s
astrology.&rdquo; I mean, this is so different in character from what
was just assumed automatically in the days when there were live
popular movements, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you&rsquo;re
privileged enough to, say, know mathematics, and you think you&rsquo;re
a part of the general world, obviously you should try to help other
people understand it. And the way you do it, for example, is by
writing books like <i>Mathematics for the Million</i>, or by giving
talks in elementary schools and things like that. In fact,
involvement in popular education goes well beyond writing books: it
means having groups, giving talks, workers&rsquo; education, all
sorts of stuff. And the fact that people on the left <i>aren&rsquo;t</i>
doing those things today I think is a real tragedy&mdash;and also
part of the really self-destructive aspect of a lot of what&rsquo;s
been happening, in my opinion. These are things that have always been
a part of live political movements.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, workers&rsquo;
education used to be a huge thing in the United States. For example,
A. J. Muste [American pacifist and activist] worked in workers&rsquo;
education for a long time, and the working-class schools he helped
set up were significant and big&mdash;people who hadn&rsquo;t gone
through elementary school came to them, and really learned a lot.
Incidentally, Muste was one of the most important people of this
century in the United States&mdash;of course, nobody knows about him,
because he did the wrong things, but he was really a leading figure
in the sort of left-libertarian movement.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">15</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">John Dewey [American
philosopher and educator] was also very much involved in popular
education, and part of it was an attempt to do just this kind of
thing. So Dewey worked with Jane Addams [American social worker and
suffragist] and others in Chicago during the Progressive Period on
community development programs and so on&mdash;in fact, the whole
progressive school movement came out of that, and it very much had
this kind of democratizing commitment and a commitment to industrial
democracy, which was considered a central part of it all.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">16</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, there were
schools like this set up all over the place&mdash;for example, in
England several of the colleges in the big universities, including
Oxford, are working-class colleges: they came out of the labor
movement, and are directed to educating working people. And even
right around here there&rsquo;s Cape Cod Community College, which
like a lot of community colleges has people teaching in it whose
interests really are this. Community colleges and urban colleges in
general have mostly working-class students, and they can be a very
good way to reach people. A lot of activists have in fact chosen to
do that&mdash;there are people teaching in community colleges all
over the place for precisely these reasons.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you&rsquo;re
right: there really ought to be more efforts put into things like
these&mdash;they would be a very important step towards
reconstituting the kinds of popular movements we need.</p>

Politics<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: What do
you think about working through the electoral process as a strategy
for activists to pursue at this point? Is that a viable way to spend
one&rsquo;s energy, if ultimately what we&rsquo;re trying to change
is the basic structure of the economy?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I think it&rsquo;s
possible to work through the electoral process. But the point we have
to remember is, things will happen through the electoral process only
if there are popular forces in motion in the society which are active
enough to be threatening to power.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for example, take
the Wagner Act of 1935 [i.e. the National Labor Relations Act], which
gave American labor the right to organize for the first time.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">17</font></sup>
It was a long time coming&mdash;most of Europe had the same rights
about fifty years earlier&mdash;and it was voted through by Congress.
But it wasn&rsquo;t voted through by Congress because Franklin
Roosevelt liked it, or because he was a liberal or anything like
that&mdash;in fact, Roosevelt was a conservative, he had no
particular interest in labor.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">18</font></sup>
The Wagner Act was voted through by Congress because the people who
do have power in the society recognized that they&rsquo;d better give
workers something, or else there was going to be real trouble. So
therefore it was voted through, and workers got the right to
organize&mdash;and they kept that right as long as they were willing
to struggle for it, then they basically lost it, it doesn&rsquo;t get
enforced much anymore.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you can get
things through the electoral process, but the electoral process is
really only a surface phenomenon: a lot of other things have to be
happening in the society for it to be very meaningful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What about
trying to get proportional representation in the United States as a
way of maybe developing a viable labor party, which could help
articulate more popular interests and broaden the range of political
debate generally? [Proportional representation refers to an electoral
system by which legislative seats are assigned according to the
proportion of votes that each party receives rather than by majority
vote in each district, which encourages the proliferation of parties
and gives minority voters better representation. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">19</font></sup>]
It seems to me that in Canada, the fact that they have a labor party
makes people somewhat more attuned to issues that Americans largely
miss, like workers&rsquo; issues for example.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s
right&mdash;Canada&rsquo;s an interesting case: it&rsquo;s a pretty
similar society to us, except different somehow. It&rsquo;s much more
humane. It has the same corporate rule, the same capitalist
institutions, all of that&rsquo;s the same&mdash;but it&rsquo;s just
a much more humane place. They have a kind of social contract that we
don&rsquo;t have, like they have this national health-care system
which makes us look bad because it&rsquo;s so efficient. And that <i>is</i>
related to their having a labor-based party, I think&mdash;the New
Democratic Party in Canada [N.D.P.] isn&rsquo;t really a <i>labor</i>
party, but it&rsquo;s kind of labor-based. However, that party&rsquo;s
ability to enter the political system in Canada wasn&rsquo;t a result
of having proportional representation, it was due to the same thing
that would be necessary to <i>get</i> any kind of change like
proportional representation in the first place: a lot of serious
popular organizing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, if you have a
political movement that&rsquo;s strong enough that the power
structure has to accommodate it, it&rsquo;ll get accommodated in some
fashion&mdash;as in the case of union organizing rights here, the
Wagner Act. But when that movement stops being active and
challenging, those rights just aren&rsquo;t going to matter very much
anymore. So I think that pushing for something like proportional
representation could be worth doing if it&rsquo;s part of a wider
organizing campaign. But if it&rsquo;s just an effort to try to put
some people into Congress and that&rsquo;s it, then it&rsquo;s pretty
much a waste of your time. I mean, there is never any point in
getting some person into office unless you can continue forcing them
to be <i>your</i> representative, and they will only continue to be
<i>your</i> representative as long as you are active and threatening
enough to make them do what you want, otherwise they&rsquo;re going
to stop being your representative.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This point has been
understood forever, actually. So if you go back to James Madison, who
framed a lot of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and so on, he
pointed out that, as he put it, a &ldquo;parchment barrier&rdquo;
will never stand in the way of oppression&mdash;meaning, writing
something down on paper is totally worthless by itself: if you fight
for it, you can make it real, otherwise you&rsquo;ll just have really
nice things on paper.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">20</font></sup>
I mean, Stalin&rsquo;s constitution was just about the nicest
constitution around&mdash;but it was a parchment barrier. And the
same is true of every other part of politics too, including having
your representative in Congress.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you can vote for
Gerry Studds [liberal Massachusetts Congressman] if you&rsquo;re from
around here, and he&rsquo;ll do some nice things&mdash;but he also
voted for N.A.F.T.A. [the North American Free Trade Agreement]. And
that was against the will of a lot of his constituents&mdash;just
because those constituents weren&rsquo;t making it clear enough to
their representative what he had to do. I mean, the anti-N.A.F.T.A.
activity that went on in the country was important, and it went way
beyond anything I ever thought it would, but it still wasn&rsquo;t
enough to get people like Gerry Studds to come along when it was
needed&mdash;and he&rsquo;s a good guy, like I gave money to the
Studds campaign. It&rsquo;s just that when you weighed all of the
pressures, there wasn&rsquo;t enough of a popular movement to get
them to come through when it mattered.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This was also part
of the problem with the Rainbow Coalition, in my opinion [progressive
political organization led by Jesse Jackson]. I mean, Jesse Jackson
was in a very strong position a couple years ago with the Rainbow
Coalition, and he had a choice. His choice was, &ldquo;Am I going to
use this opportunity to help create a continuing grassroots
organization which will keep on working after the election, or am I
going to use it as my own personal vehicle of political promotion?&rdquo;
And he more or less chose the latter&mdash;so it died. Therefore it
was a complete waste of time: anybody who spent time working on that
campaign was wasting their time, because it was used as an electoral
platform, and that never makes sense. I mean, whenever somebody says
&ldquo;I want to become President,&rdquo; you can forget it&mdash;as
President, they won&rsquo;t be any different from George Bush.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So as far as I can
see, getting proportional representation in the United States today
would have basically no effect, the effect would be essentially
zilch&mdash;just because there&rsquo;s nothing around to take
advantage of it. On the other hand, if it was passed at a time when
you had popular grassroots organizations of the kind that developed,
say, in Haiti in the late 1980s, sure, then it could make a
difference. But of course, it&rsquo;s only under those circumstances
that you would ever <i>get</i> proportional representation in the
first place.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So in my view, any
of these things could be fine if they&rsquo;re being used as
organizing tools to try to get things going: they&rsquo;re a waste of
time if you actually take them seriously in themselves, but if
they&rsquo;re understood simply as a part of larger popular
struggles&mdash;so this is what you&rsquo;re focusing on right now,
but the purpose isn&rsquo;t to get some words written down somewhere
or some person into office, but rather it&rsquo;s to get people to
understand the <i>importance</i> of the words and the need to keep
fighting for them&mdash;yeah, then it can mean something.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: So you
think that trying to develop a third party here might be worth doing?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Sure, absolutely&mdash;I
think that could be a very important step. Take Canada again: why
does Canada have the health-care program it does? Up until the
mid-1960s, Canada and the United States had the same capitalist
health service: extremely inefficient, tons of bureaucracy, huge
administrative  costs, millions of people with no insurance
coverage&mdash;exactly what would be amplified in the United States
by Clinton&rsquo;s proposals for &ldquo;managed competition&rdquo;
[put forward in 1993].<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">21</font></sup>
But in 1962 in Saskatchewan, where the N.D.P. is pretty strong and
the unions are pretty strong, they managed to put through a kind of
rational health-care program of the sort that every industrialized
country in the world has by now, except the United States and South
Africa. Well, when Saskatchewan first put through that program, the
doctors and the insurance companies and the business community were
all screaming&mdash;but it worked so well that pretty soon all the
other Provinces wanted the same thing too, and within a couple years
guaranteed health care had spread over the entire country. And that
happened largely because of the New Democratic Party in Canada, which
does provide a kind of cover and a framework within which popular
organizations like unions, and then later things like the feminist
movement, have been able to get together and do things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, in the United
States there are also a lot of popular organizations, but they&rsquo;re
all separate, there&rsquo;s no framework to start bringing them
together. So developing a popularly-based third party here could be a
very important step towards that, and I think it should be pursued.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, there have
even been some encouraging developments in recent years in getting
something like that off the ground&mdash;I&rsquo;m thinking of the
emergence of the New Party, specifically, which is sort of trying to
follow the Canadian model. So again, I don&rsquo;t think that we
should have any illusions about working through the political system,
and I&rsquo;m not much of a fan of political parties&mdash;but the
New Party is really the first serious third-party alternative that
I&rsquo;ve seen in the United States: seriously thought-out, trying
to create grassroots structures, using politics the way it ought to
be used, as an organizing and pressuring technique, and hoping
ultimately to get to the point where it could have real influence.
Now, they&rsquo;re not going to make structural reforms&mdash;that
requires much bigger changes, changes in the institutions. I mean,
when the N.D.P. got into power in Ontario in 1990, they couldn&rsquo;t
really do anything, they just carried out the normal right-wing
policies, and in the next national election [in 1993] they got like
two votes, nobody wanted to bother with them anymore. But even given
those limitations, I still think it&rsquo;s important for a country
to have something like that&mdash;there&rsquo;s a lot of potential to
help make people&rsquo;s lives better, and it certainly could be a
basis for moving further and pressing for larger changes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, that same
kind of thinking extends to electoral politics in general, in my
view. I mean, right now voting decisions in the United States are
pretty subtle tactical matters, in which the policy differences
between the two major parties are not great. But just because I say
they&rsquo;re &ldquo;tactical,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t mean to demean
it: the decisions that have serious human consequences and matter for
people are <i>mostly</i> tactical judgments, after all. Like, we can
have big discussions about what society ought to look like in the
future,  which is fine, but that doesn&rsquo;t affect what happens to
people in their lives right now, except extremely indirectly. What
happens to people in their daily lives usually depends on small,
difficult, tactical assessments about where to put your time and
energy&mdash;and one of those decisions is whether you should vote,
and if so, who should you vote for. And that can be an extremely
important decision, with significant implications.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So for example, we
have a national election coming up in the United States soon [in
1996], and I don&rsquo;t really know of any very strong arguments one
way or another about who to vote for&mdash;but that&rsquo;s not to
say that that judgment is an unimportant one: I think it&rsquo;s very
important. I mean, I&rsquo;ll vote for Clinton, holding my nose&mdash;but
the reason has nothing at all to do with big policy issues; there I
can&rsquo;t really see too much difference. What it has to do with
are things like who&rsquo;s going to get appointed to the judiciary:
there are some differences between the Republicans and Democrats on
questions like that, and who&rsquo;s appointed to the judiciary
happens to have a big effect on people&rsquo;s lives. They may be
small policy differences when you look at the big picture&mdash;but
remember, there&rsquo;s a huge amount of power out there, and small
policy differences implementing a huge amount of power can make big
differences to people. Or there might be a slight difference in
things like the earned income tax credit [a tax refund program for
poor working individuals and families]. Okay, that makes a lot of
difference for people whose kids are hungry in downtown Boston, say.
So that&rsquo;ll be my decision in this election&mdash;again, holding
my nose. And that&rsquo;s the way it is at the upper levels of our
political system generally, I think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, one way
for third parties to address this situation is to run &ldquo;fusion&rdquo;
candidates&mdash;meaning, you have your own third-party ballot-line
which stands for whatever you stand for, say for
social-democratic-type programs, but then you have that ballot-line
vote go to one of the main-party candidates in the election, based on
these sort of tactical decisions. That&rsquo;s possible in some
jurisdictions. And it&rsquo;s a compromise way for a third party to
preserve a genuine policy identity and commitment, while nevertheless
letting people make the small tactical voting choices that can make a
real difference to people&mdash;and I think it&rsquo;s a very
plausible compromise.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, if only a few
people do it, it isn&rsquo;t going to have any effect&mdash;it just
means that some guy picking bananas in East Costa Rica isn&rsquo;t
going to have  enough money to feed his children tomorrow. But if
it&rsquo;s done on a large enough scale that it can have an impact on
the corporate structure, sure, then it could mean something.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, suppose you
stopped consuming altogether&mdash;you can live on subsistence
farming in the United States in a lot of places, so suppose you did
that. The effect on the general society would be exactly as if you
decided to commit suicide: it would simply go on as before, but
without you. Bear in mind that a lot of these things about &ldquo;let&rsquo;s
really make a change by withdrawing from the world and living a
decent life&rdquo; have precisely the social effect of suicide&mdash;well,
that&rsquo;s a little too extreme, because people might notice and
become interested and involved, so maybe it&rsquo;s a little bit more
than suicide. But not a lot. And in fact, the only thing that does
differentiate it from suicide is when you use it as an organizing
tool.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">22</font></sup>
Otherwise not, otherwise in fact it is just like suicide.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Would you
ever advocate a boycott as a tactic, though, assuming that it was
coordinated and on a large enough scale?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, tactics depend
on the specific situations you&rsquo;re faced with&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
think you can say very much worthwhile about them in the abstract. So
there might be a particular moment when a boycott of something would
be helpful. But as a general matter, I don&rsquo;t think they really
make a lot of sense, frankly.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, suppose we
got millions of people to stop buying: what would happen? The
economic system barely functions as it is&mdash;I mean, the
contemporary economic system is a complete catastrophe, an absolutely
catastrophic failure. For instance, the International Labor
Organization recently gave its latest estimate of unemployment
worldwide&mdash;&ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; they define as meaning not
having enough work to meet a subsistence level, so maybe you can sell
some handkerchiefs at a street corner or something, but you don&rsquo;t
have enough work to survive on your own. They estimate that at about
30 percent of the world&rsquo;s population&mdash;which makes it a lot
worse than the Great Depression.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">23</font></sup>
Alright? Now, there&rsquo;s a ton of work to be done in the
world&mdash;everywhere you look there&rsquo;s work that ought to be
done. And the people who don&rsquo;t have work would be delighted to
do it. So what you&rsquo;ve got is a huge number of idle hands, a
vast amount of work that ought to be done, and an economic system
that is incapable of putting those two things together. Okay,
absolutely catastrophic failure. Boycotts aren&rsquo;t going to
overcome that failure, they&rsquo;re just going to make it worse.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you know, they
may be worthwhile as a tactic at some point, but what&rsquo;s really
required is just a complete rethinking of the entire nature of
economic interactions and structures&mdash;there really is no other
way to overcome this whole massive failure of the economy.</p>

Praxis&rdquo;<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Dr. Chomsky,
as I listen to you talk and give your marvelous analysis of the
destructions of capitalism and American foreign policy, and even as I
hear you today give us some of your perspectives on more practical
issues of activism, I&rsquo;m often struck by what I hear to be an
underlying generality to your advice: it seems there&rsquo;s almost
the absence of a concrete program. Don&rsquo;t you think that it
would be helpful to give people a little bit more guidance about what
to do specifically, especially since people are so directionless
these days?</i></p>
<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.15in; margin-top: 0.08in; margin-bottom: 0.08in; line-height: 0.28in">
<i>What I&rsquo;m saying is, I don&rsquo;t see a revolutionary
&ldquo;praxis&rdquo; in your politics&mdash;and I&rsquo;m wondering
why that is.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, when you say
there&rsquo;s no &ldquo;praxis,&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t exactly know
what that means. There are plenty of things that can be done; I don&rsquo;t
think they have to be described with fancy terms. And we just do the
things that can be done, the kinds of things that are the next stage.
There aren&rsquo;t any general formulas about that&mdash;you just ask
where you are, what are the problems that exist, where are people
ready to move? And then you try to do something with them. There&rsquo;s
a whole spectrum of actions you can take, and there&rsquo;s no simple
answer as to which ones should have the priority&mdash;people judge
differently.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But I&rsquo;d be
very skeptical if somebody comes along with a &ldquo;praxis&rdquo;&mdash;you
know, some formula saying, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;re
supposed to do it.&rdquo; I&rsquo;d be <i>really</i> skeptical about
that, if I were you.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8742_2032848809"></a>The
War on Unions<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, I
know a lot of people fighting for Workmen&rsquo;s Compensation [i.e.
for on-the-job injuries] and things like that, and sometimes they&rsquo;ve
said to me, &ldquo;If I try to get together with other workers to
press for changes, I&rsquo;m going to get in trouble, I&rsquo;ll lose
my job&mdash;what the hell can I do except look out for Number One?&rdquo;
They&rsquo;re not happy about that option, nobody&rsquo;s happy about
saying, &ldquo;All I can do is duck and cover and look out for
myself, never be loyal to anybody else or support other workers&rdquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s
just that there are these consequences that they can&rsquo;t deal
with. I don&rsquo;t have an answer for them, I really don&rsquo;t
know what to say to that.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, there really
<i>is</i> no answer, unless there are organizations&mdash;in this
case, unions&mdash;that are strong enough to fight for them. I mean,
if you don&rsquo;t have solidarity and organization and you&rsquo;re
just out there alone fighting a big system of power, there&rsquo;s
not very much that you can do. It&rsquo;s like if you&rsquo;re
walking down the streets of Haiti [under the military junta] and
somebody  comes up to you and says, &ldquo;What should I do?&rdquo;&mdash;the
answer &ldquo;Go attack the police station&rdquo; is not very
helpful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The only thing that
these people looking for workmen&rsquo;s comp can do is be involved
in strong enough organizations, and in this case that means unions&mdash;or
maybe they can get somebody from the National Lawyers Guild
[progressive law organization] or something to help them work through
the legal structures. Short of having an organization that you can be
part of that will defend you, though, there&rsquo;s really not much
you can do&mdash;and that&rsquo;s precisely why there&rsquo;s been
such a passionate effort by the business world and the government to
try to destroy unions. I mean, ever since the Wagner Act first got
passed in 1935, there has been a sustained campaign in the United
States to destroy the labor movement and to overcome this tragedy.
And there&rsquo;s a very good reason for that: if people are all
alone, they really are defenseless, they just assume &ldquo;I can
only look out for myself,&rdquo; and then that builds up a real
privatization of interests, which in turn contributes to their
oppression. But of course, the dynamic also goes the other way
too&mdash;when you organize with other people, you develop your sense
of solidarity and sympathy, and that helps break down the oppression.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, this all
goes back to James Madison&rsquo;s point again: there are &ldquo;parchment
barriers&rdquo; which say that you <i>can&rsquo;t</i> fire workers
for trying to organize, there are federal laws that make that
completely illegal. But because for whatever reason people have not
been able to fight to maintain those laws, the government just
doesn&rsquo;t enforce them anymore. I mean, the reason the people
you&rsquo;re talking about <i>can</i> be fired is that the government
is a criminal operation: it doesn&rsquo;t enforce the laws. Therefore
employers have this real weapon over people&rsquo;s heads, which is a
very powerful one, as you say.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, there was
an interesting article about this in <i>Business Week</i> a little
while ago. It was about the destruction of unions in the United
States, and what they pointed out&mdash;kind of casually, not making
a big point of it&mdash;is that part of the way that unions have been
destroyed here is just by a huge increase in illegal firings,
particularly during the 1980s. The Wagner Act makes that flatly
illegal, but since the federal government is a criminal operation and
doesn&rsquo;t enforce the laws, employers just do whatever they feel
like. The same thing was true with industrial accidents: they shot
way up in the 1980s, because the Reagan administration just refused
to enforce the laws regulating workplace safety. And this is all
right out in the open&mdash;like, <i>Business Week</i> says it
straight out: &ldquo;illegal firings,&rdquo; nobody&rsquo;s trying to
cover it up.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">24</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Can&rsquo;t
employers fire employees &ldquo;at will&rdquo; in the U.S., though?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No&mdash;if
employees are trying to organize and they get fired, that&rsquo;s
against the law, it&rsquo;s flatly illegal.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">25</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: It&rsquo;s
tough to prove, though.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s tough to
prove if the government won&rsquo;t prosecute, or if the courts won&rsquo;t
hear it, or if the National Labor Relations Board is set up in such a
way that you&rsquo;ve got to work for five years before your case
ever gets heard&mdash;by which time everybody&rsquo;s either gone
away or dropped dead or something. I mean, these are all just various
techniques of state criminality to evade very clear legislation. In
fact, the United States has been censured by the International Labor
Organization for violating international labor standards&mdash;it&rsquo;s
probably the only industrial society the I.L.O. has ever censured,
because this is a U.N. agency, so it&rsquo;s largely paid for by the
U.S., and they never say anything bad about the people who pay their
wages. But the I.L.O. in 1991 censured the United States for
violating international labor standards at the time of the
Caterpillar strike, when the government permitted the corporation to
bring in scabs [workers who cross the picket-line] to break the
strike.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">26</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the same sorts
of things are happening under Bill Clinton too. So one of the
campaign issues that got Clinton a lot of labor support in 1992 was
that he promised to put some teeth in the law that makes it illegal
for employers to hire scabs&mdash;which basically destroys any
strike. I mean, when you&rsquo;ve got a huge unemployed labor force,
and you don&rsquo;t have a sense of working-class solidarity in the
population, and a ton of people are desperate, if you go on strike
and get replaced by scabs, okay, that&rsquo;s the end of the
strike&mdash;so that kills strikes. Now, this is unheard of: no
modern country permits this. In fact, at the time that the I.L.O.
censured the U.S., only the U.S. and South Africa allowed it, though
by now I think it&rsquo;s spreading for all kinds of reasons,
especially in England. But one of Clinton&rsquo;s big campaign
promises in &rsquo;92 was that he was going to put a stop to this
practice&mdash;and just now he&rsquo;s sort of backed off from that,
under the threat of a filibuster [the practice of blocking
legislation in Congress by indefinitely prolonging debate]. The
people in Congress who were pushing it said, rightly or wrongly, that
they couldn&rsquo;t overcome a filibuster&mdash;and so he stopped.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">27</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
again the same interaction: there are already laws on the books that
make hiring scabs illegal, but laws only get enforced if people are
willing to fight for them, otherwise they don&rsquo;t get enforced. I
mean, it&rsquo;s nice to have the laws, but it&rsquo;s nice partly
because it makes it easier to struggle for your rights&mdash;it&rsquo;s
not that the laws <i>give</i> you the rights. Laws can be on the
books and mean absolutely nothing, as in this case.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are also a
number of other tricks which are being used all around the world to
destroy unions. So for example, in England under Margaret Thatcher
[Prime Minister from 1979 to &rsquo;90], which was very similar to
Reaganite America in many ways, there was also a major effort to try
to destroy the labor movement&mdash;and by now it&rsquo;s pretty much
gone there too. It&rsquo;s not quite as bad as the United States yet,
but it&rsquo;s going that way. And remember,  the labor movement used
to be very strong in England, just like in Canada. In fact, the
British labor movement led the way in a lot of respects in pushing
through the wave of modern social reform after the Second World War.
But now employers in England are allowed to pay differential wages to
workers depending on whether or not they unionize&mdash;in other
words they can say, &ldquo;If you refuse to join the union I&rsquo;ll
increase your wages; if you join the union I&rsquo;ll lower your
wages.&rdquo; Well, that&rsquo;s devastating for unions.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take another
trick they just instituted there, which is absolutely lethal for
organizing. Union dues have traditionally been paid by a check-off:
you agree that some part of your salary is going to be deducted for
union dues, just like some part of it gets deducted for Social
Security. Well, the Conservative John Major government in England
just passed an administrative regulation or something that requires
all union members to regularly renew their authorization for this
check-off&mdash;meaning the British labor movement now has to reach
six million people somewhere and periodically get them to sign a
statement saying, &ldquo;I agree to continue doing this.&rdquo;
Alright, that is just an <i>incredible</i> burden. Even the
mainstream British press pointed out that if you tried to do that to
banks, like make banks regularly get written agreements from
everybody they&rsquo;ve ever lent money to or something that they&rsquo;re
still going to pay it back, the financial system would probably
collapse.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">28</font></sup>
And the labor movement mostly runs by unpaid volunteers&mdash;they
don&rsquo;t have the money to pay people, so it&rsquo;s usually
volunteers who keep the unions going. So now those volunteers have to
take time off from their other activities to try to round up six
million people from all around the country, who&rsquo;ve moved since
you last heard of them and this and that, just to get them to sign
some statement they&rsquo;ve already signed before allowing the
unions to make this check-off of dues.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
the kind of thing that&rsquo;s been happening all over the place in
recent years&mdash;and it&rsquo;s all going to keep on going. I mean,
there are all kinds of ways in which power can try to destroy popular
organizations: it doesn&rsquo;t have to be death squads like it is in
the Third World. And unless there is enough popular pressure and
organizing to overcome it&mdash;and in fact, <i>progress</i>&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
win. So I don&rsquo;t know how many of you have tried to organize
these days, but it&rsquo;s extremely hard&mdash;partly just because
there are a lot of barriers that have been set up to make it very
difficult to do, many of them instituted in the 1980s. But they&rsquo;re
obstacles we&rsquo;re just going to have to overcome.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8744_2032848809"></a>Inner-City
Schools<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, a
number of activists I know are on welfare, and their children are
going to public schools that increasingly are resembling prisons:
there are armed guards in the halls, there&rsquo;s a high level of
violence. And I know some of these kids, they&rsquo;re really
brutalized&mdash;if they&rsquo;re not chronically  depressed, then
they&rsquo;re violent: violent in language, violent in fact. One of
the mothers recently told me&mdash;and she&rsquo;s a pretty radical
person&mdash;that the conservative &ldquo;School Choice Movement&rdquo;
[whereby the state would subsidize tuition at private institutions
instead of administering public schools] really is appealing to her.
It surprised me, but she said, &ldquo;The left isn&rsquo;t addressing
the problem of the schools, the left is sentimental about public
education.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m wondering what you think about that?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think there&rsquo;s
a lot of truth to it. I mean, it&rsquo;s the same with crime&mdash;people
are really scared, especially people in poor neighborhoods. It&rsquo;s
not so bad where I live, in the fancy suburbs, but if you live in a
poor neighborhood, it&rsquo;s frightening&mdash;unpleasant things can
happen to you and your children. And when it&rsquo;s frightening,
people want something to protect themselves&mdash;and if protecting
yourself means having armed guards all around, or calling for more
use of the death penalty or something, well, then you&rsquo;ll go for
that. If the choices are narrowed to your child being attacked in the
halls and getting a rotten education, or having &ldquo;private
choices&rdquo;&mdash;sure, people will pick the &ldquo;private
choices.&rdquo; But the task of the left is to <i>extend</i> those
options, to let people know that there is another option, the option
of a decent life: which is neither schools as prisons, nor pull
yourself out and let everybody else stay in the prison&mdash;which is
what the whole &ldquo;privatization of education&rdquo; story is
really about.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But sure: if people
can&rsquo;t see any other alternatives, they&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
pull myself out.&rdquo; In fact, I did the same thing. Why do I live
in the suburbs? Because my wife and I wanted our kids to go to a good
school, first person to tell you. Of course I did that, and people
who have that option will do it&mdash;but the idea is to set up a
system in which people don&rsquo;t ever have to face that narrow set
of alternatives, all of them awful.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I do think it&rsquo;s
true, though, that at this point the left is basically offering
nothing in the way of alternatives. What it <i>ought</i> to be
getting across is the message, &ldquo;Look, this is <i>not</i> the
full range of alternatives, there are others&rdquo;&mdash;and then it
should present the others. And the others are not utopian. I mean,
just look at the history of inner-city schools in the United States:
there was a period, not so far back, when many of the inner-city
schools here were extremely good&mdash;in fact, some of the black
inner-city schools in Washington had among the highest
college-acceptance rates in the country.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">29</font></sup>
Or take my own family, for example: they were immigrants from Eastern
Europe&mdash;not peasants, but from a very poor Eastern European
background&mdash;and they went through ordinary city schools in New
York, some of them went to the City College, and they got very good
educations. In fact, the City College of New York used to be one of
the best schools in the country: public city school, no reason why it
shouldn&rsquo;t be.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So good public
education can certainly be achieved&mdash;but of course, like
everything else, it&rsquo;s going to depend on the general social and
economic structure in which it operates. I mean, it&rsquo;s true that
things like violence and  rotten schools are destroying the
cities&mdash;but they&rsquo;re destroying them because of a social
structure that we&rsquo;ve just got to change, from the bottom up.
And yes, until people can see some hope of changing it, they&rsquo;re
going to pick from within the rotten set of options that are being
presented to them.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8746_2032848809"></a>Defending
the Welfare State<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam,
since you&rsquo;re an anarchist and often say that you oppose the
existence of the nation-state itself and think it&rsquo;s
incompatible with true socialism, does that make you at all reluctant
to defend welfare programs and other social services which are now
under attack from the right wing, and which the right wing wants to
dismantle?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it&rsquo;s
true that the anarchist vision in just about all its varieties has
looked forward to dismantling state power&mdash;and personally I
share that vision. But right now it runs directly counter to my
goals: my immediate goals have been, and now very much are, to defend
and even strengthen certain elements of state authority that are now
under severe attack. And I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s any
contradiction there&mdash;none at all, really.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For example, take
the so-called &ldquo;welfare state.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s called the
&ldquo;welfare state&rdquo; is essentially a recognition that every
child has a right to have food, and to have health care and so on&mdash;and
as I&rsquo;ve been saying, those programs were set up in the
nation-state system after a century of very hard struggle, by the
labor movement, and the socialist movement, and so on. Well,
according to the new spirit of the age, in the case of a
fourteen-year-old girl who got raped and has a child, her child has
to learn &ldquo;personal responsibility&rdquo; by not accepting state
welfare handouts, meaning, by not having enough to eat. Alright, I
don&rsquo;t agree with that at any level. In fact, I think it&rsquo;s
grotesque at any level. I think those children should be saved. And
in today&rsquo;s world, that&rsquo;s going to have to involve working
through the state system; it&rsquo;s not the only case.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So despite the
anarchist &ldquo;vision,&rdquo; I think aspects of the state system,
like the one that makes sure children eat, have to be defended&mdash;in
fact, defended very vigorously. And given the accelerating effort
that&rsquo;s being made these days to roll back the victories for
justice and human rights which have been won through long and often
extremely bitter struggles in the West, in my opinion the immediate
goal of even committed anarchists should be to defend some state
institutions, while helping to pry them open to more meaningful
public participation, and ultimately to dismantle them in a much more
free society.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There are practical
problems of tomorrow on which people&rsquo;s lives very much depend,
and while defending these kinds of programs is by no means the
ultimate end we should be pursuing, in my view we still have to face
the problems that are right on the horizon, and which seriously
affect human  lives. I don&rsquo;t think those things can simply be
forgotten because they might not fit within some radical slogan that
reflects a deeper vision of a future society. The deeper visions
should be maintained, they&rsquo;re important&mdash;but dismantling
the state system is a goal that&rsquo;s a lot farther away, and you
want to deal first with what&rsquo;s at hand and nearby, I think. And
in any realistic perspective, the political system, with all its
flaws, does have opportunities for participation by the general
population which other existing institutions, such as corporations,
don&rsquo;t have. In fact, that&rsquo;s exactly why the far right
wants to <i>weaken</i> governmental structures&mdash;because if you
can make sure that all the key decisions are in the hands of
Microsoft and General Electric and Raytheon, then you don&rsquo;t
have to worry anymore about the threat of popular involvement in
policy-making.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So take something
that&rsquo;s been happening in recent years: devolution&mdash;that
is, removing authority from the federal government down to the state
governments. Well, in some circumstances, that would be a
democratizing move which I would be in favor of&mdash;it would be a
move away from central authority down to local authority. But that&rsquo;s
in abstract circumstances that don&rsquo;t exist. Right now it&rsquo;ll
happen because moving decision-making power down to the state level
in fact means handing it over to private power. See, huge
corporations can influence and dominate the federal government, but
even middle-sized corporations can influence state governments and
play one state&rsquo;s workforce off against another&rsquo;s by
threatening to move production elsewhere unless they get better tax
breaks and so on. So under the conditions of existing systems of
power, devolution is very anti-democratic; under other systems of
much greater equality, devolution could be highly democratic&mdash;but
these are questions which really can&rsquo;t be discussed in
isolation from the society as it actually exists.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So I think that it&rsquo;s
completely realistic and rational to work within structures to which
you are opposed, because by doing so you can help to move to a
situation where then you can challenge those structures.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Let me just give you
an analogy. I don&rsquo;t like to have armed police everywhere, I
think it&rsquo;s a bad idea. On the other hand, a number of years ago
when I had little kids, there was a rabid raccoon running around our
neighborhood biting children. Well, we tried various ways of getting
rid of it&mdash;you know, &ldquo;Have-A-Heart&rdquo; animal traps,
all this kind of stuff&mdash;but nothing worked. So finally we just
called the police and had them do it: it was better than having the
kids bitten by a rabid raccoon, right? Is there a contradiction
there? No: in particular circumstances, you sometimes have to accept
and use illegitimate structures.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, we happen to
have a huge rabid raccoon running around&mdash;it&rsquo;s called
corporations. And there is nothing in the society right now that can
protect people from that tyranny, except the federal government. Now,
it doesn&rsquo;t protect them very <i>well</i>, because mostly it&rsquo;s
run by the corporations, but still it does have some limited
effect&mdash;it can enforce regulatory measures under public
pressure, let&rsquo;s say, it can reduce dangerous toxic waste
disposal, it can set minimal standards on health care, and so on. In
fact, it has various things that it can do to improve the situation
when there&rsquo;s this huge rabid raccoon dominating the place. So,
fine, I think we ought to get it to do the things it can do&mdash;if
you can get rid of the <i>raccoon</i>, great, then let&rsquo;s
dismantle the federal government. But to say, &ldquo;Okay, let&rsquo;s
just get rid of the federal government as soon as we possibly can,&rdquo;
and then let the private tyrannies take over <i>everything</i>&mdash;I
mean, for an anarchist to advocate that is just outlandish, in my
opinion. So I really don&rsquo;t see any contradiction at all here.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Supporting these
aspects of the governmental structures just seems to me to be part of
a willingness to face some of the complexities of life for what they
are&mdash;and the complexities of life include the fact that there
are a lot of ugly things out there, and if you care about the fact
that some kid in downtown Boston is starving, or that some poor
person can&rsquo;t get adequate medical care, or that somebody&rsquo;s
going to pour toxic waste in your backyard, or anything at all like
that, well, then you try to stop it. And there&rsquo;s only one
institution around right now that can stop it. If you just want to be
pure and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m against power, period,&rdquo; well,
okay, say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m against the federal government.&rdquo;
But that&rsquo;s just to divorce yourself from any human concerns, in
my view. And I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a reasonable stance for
anarchists or anyone else to take.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8748_2032848809"></a>Pension
Funds and the Law<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Mr. Chomsky,
if what I&rsquo;ve been told is correct, almost half of
publicly-owned stock in the United States is in privately-held
pension trusts, such as union trust funds. I&rsquo;m wondering, if
restrictions like those under E.R.I.S.A. [the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act] can be modified so that workers could control
their own funds, do you think that it would be possible to support a
collaborative or union-based or popularly-based effort to direct that
money towards socially responsible investment&mdash;like away from
companies that are breaking unions and so on?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, notice that
whatever the numbers are, it&rsquo;s huge&mdash;but that money is <i>not</i>
in the hands of labor unions, it&rsquo;s in the hands of Goldman
Sachs [investment firm]. And in fact, if the government enforced the
laws, the trustees of those pension funds would be in serious trouble
right now&mdash;because they have violated their legal responsibility
to invest those funds in safe investments. For instance, they are
investing your pensions in things like junk bonds in Mexico&mdash;and
the people making those investment decisions would be legally liable
for that, if we applied our laws, because they have a trust to invest
those funds in secure investments, and they don&rsquo;t do it. They
just do whatever they want with them. Now, they&rsquo;re <i>not</i>
going to be in trouble, because we don&rsquo;t have a real justice
system&mdash;we only go after poor  people. But they should be, and
in fact, I think the labor movement ought to ask for that now: like,
Rubin, the guy who&rsquo;s Secretary of the Treasury, he should
probably be in jail just because of the Mexican economic collapse
alone [in December 1994], which he allowed to happen.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">30</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is,
you could democratize the unions enough so that they could actually
take <i>control</i> of their own resources. And that would be a very
important step. I mean, there&rsquo;s a lot of potential for activism
and popular-based efforts there, you&rsquo;re right. And it doesn&rsquo;t
have to stop at their own pensions, you know: what about the
factories in which they work? Why should they be in the hands of
private investors? That&rsquo;s not a law of nature. Why should a
corporation have the rights of an individual?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">31</font></sup>
A corporation is a public trust: you go back just a century, and
governments were taking away corporate charters because corporations
weren&rsquo;t living up to the &ldquo;public interest.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">32</font></sup>
It&rsquo;s a very recent idea that these totalitarian institutions
should be totally unaccountable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, yes, workers
ought to have control of their pension funds&mdash;but also
everything else too: that is, the society ought to be democratized.
And this is not a particularly radical idea, actually: you go back to
the guys who founded the American Federation of Labor a century
ago&mdash;the A.F.L. is not a flaming radical organization&mdash;they
said, look, working people ought to control the places where they
work, there&rsquo;s no reason why they should be controlled by some
rich guy out there who put some money into it and has nothing to do
with it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">33</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s true too, just like it&rsquo;s true of pension funds&mdash;and
that would be a move towards a democratic society, as was always
understood in fact, until the independent working-class culture was
eliminated in the United States. So pension funds are only a part of
it: a big part, but only part.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What do you
think the role of law is generally in the whole scheme of control?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, law is a bit
like a printing press&mdash;it&rsquo;s kind of neutral, you can make
it do anything. I mean, what lawyers are taught in law school is
chicanery: how to convert words on paper into instruments of power.
And depending where the power is, the law will mean different things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: So you don&rsquo;t
think there&rsquo;s any legal basis for the hegemony of American
corporations, especially in the way that the Fourteenth Amendment was
interpreted to consider them individuals, with individual rights?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you know,
&ldquo;legal basis&rdquo; is a funny notion: what has a legal basis
is a matter of power, not law&mdash;like, the Fourteenth Amendment
doesn&rsquo;t say anything about corporations. During the nineteenth
century, there was just a change in the legal status of
corporations&mdash;a change which would have absolutely appalled Adam
Smith, or Thomas Jefferson, or any other Enlightenment  thinker. In
fact, Smith warned against it, and Jefferson lived long enough to see
the beginnings of it&mdash;and what he said is, if what he called the
&ldquo;banks and moneyed incorporations&rdquo; got the rights that
they in fact ended up receiving, we would have a form of absolutism
worse than the one we thought we were fighting against in the
American Revolution.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">34</font></sup>
And those rights simply were granted&mdash;they weren&rsquo;t granted
by Congress, and in other countries they weren&rsquo;t granted by
Parliaments; they were granted by judges, lawyers, corporate
representatives, and others, completely outside the democratic
system. And they simply created another world&mdash;they created a
world of absolutist power which was very new.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">35</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There&rsquo;s a lot
of good work on this by what are called Critical Legal historians,
Morton Horwitz at Harvard and others. Also, Oxford University Press
has a book by a historian at the University of California named
Charles Sellers, who discusses some of this: it&rsquo;s called <i>The
Market Revolution</i> .<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">36</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s the basic story, though: these laws were made by a big
power-play, completely outside of popular control. Okay, as usual,
the guys with the guns are the ones that decide what the law is.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8750_2032848809"></a>Conspiracy
Theories<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, you
mentioned earlier how &ldquo;conspiracy theories&rdquo; take up a lot
of energy in the left movements these days, particularly on the West
Coast and with respect to the Kennedy assassination&mdash;and you
said that in your view, it&rsquo;s a totally wasted effort. Do you
really feel there&rsquo;s nothing at all worthwhile in that kind of
inquiry?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, let me put it
this way. Every example we find of planning decisions in the society
is a case where some people got together and tried to use whatever
power they could draw upon to achieve a result&mdash;if you like,
those are &ldquo;conspiracies.&rdquo; That means that almost
everything that happens in the world is a &ldquo;conspiracy.&rdquo;
If the Board of Directors of General Motors gets together and decides
what kind of car to produce next year, that&rsquo;s a conspiracy.
Every business decision, every editorial decision is a conspiracy. If
the Linguistics Department I work in decides who to appoint next
year, that&rsquo;s a conspiracy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, obviously
that&rsquo;s not interesting: all decisions involve people. So the
real question is, are there groupings well outside the structures of
the major institutions of the society which go around them, hijack
them, undermine them, pursue other courses without an institutional
base, and so on and so forth? And that&rsquo;s a question of fact: do
significant things happen because groups or subgroups are acting in
secret outside the main structures of institutional power?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, as I look over
history, I don&rsquo;t find much of that. I mean, there are <i>some</i>
cases&mdash;for instance, at one point a group of Nazi generals
thought of  assassinating Hitler. Okay, that&rsquo;s a conspiracy.
But things like that are real blips on the screen, as far as I can
see. Now, if people want to spend time studying the group of Nazi
generals who decided it was time to get rid of Hitler, that&rsquo;s a
fine topic for a monograph&mdash;maybe somebody will write a thesis
about it. But we&rsquo;re not going to learn anything about the world
from it, at least nothing that generalizes to the next case&mdash;it&rsquo;s
all going to be historically contingent and specific; it&rsquo;ll
show you how one particular group of people acted under particular
circumstances. Fine.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And if you look at
the place where investigation of &ldquo;conspiracies&rdquo; has
absolutely flourished, modern American history, I think what&rsquo;s
notable is the <i>absence</i> of such cases&mdash;at least as I read
the record, they almost never happen. I mean, occasionally you&rsquo;ll
find something like the Reaganites, with their off-the-shelf
subversive and terrorist activities, but that was sort of a fringe
operation&mdash;and in fact, part of the reason why a lot of it got
exposed so quickly is because the institutions are simply too
powerful to tolerate very much of that stuff. As far as the Pentagon
goes, sure, the Services will push their own interests&mdash;but
typically they do it in pretty transparent ways.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take the C.I.A.,
which is considered the source of a lot of these conspiracies: we
have a ton of information about it, and as I read the information,
the C.I.A. is basically just an obedient branch of the White House. I
mean, sure, the C.I.A. has done things around the world&mdash;but as
far as we know, it hasn&rsquo;t done anything on its own. There&rsquo;s
very little evidence&mdash;in fact, I don&rsquo;t know of any&mdash;that
the C.I.A. is some kind of rogue elephant, you know, off on its own
doing things. What the record shows is that the C.I.A. is just an
agency of the White House, which sometimes carries out operations for
which the Executive branch wants what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;plausible
deniability&rdquo;: in other words, if something goes wrong, we don&rsquo;t
want it to look like we did it, those guys in the C.I.A. did it, and
we can throw some of them to the wolves if we need to.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">37</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s basically the role of the C.I.A., along with mostly just
collection of information.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s the same
with the Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, all
these other things that people are racing around searching for
conspiracy theories about&mdash;they&rsquo;re &ldquo;nothing&rdquo;
organizations. Of course they&rsquo;re <i>there</i>, obviously rich
people get together and talk to each other, and play golf with one
another, and plan together&mdash;that&rsquo;s not a big surprise. But
these conspiracy theories people are putting their energies into have
virtually nothing to do with the way the institutions actually
<i>function.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The
Kennedy-assassination cult is probably the most striking case. I
mean, you have all these people doing super-scholarly intensive
research, and trying to find out just who talked to whom, and what
the exact contours were of this supposed high-level conspiracy&mdash;it&rsquo;s
all complete nonsense. As soon as you look into the various theories,
they always collapse, there&rsquo;s just nothing there.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">38</font></sup>
But in many places, the left has just fallen apart on the basis of
these sheer cults.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: There&rsquo;s
perhaps one exception, though&mdash;what about Martin Luther King&rsquo;s
assassination?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s
interesting&mdash;see, that&rsquo;s the one case where you can
imagine pretty plausible reasons why people would have wanted to kill
him, and I would not be in the least surprised if there in fact <i>was</i>
a real conspiracy behind that one, probably a high-level conspiracy.
I mean, the mechanisms were there, maybe they would have hired
somebody from the Mafia or something to do it&mdash;but that
conspiracy theory is perfectly plausible, I think. And interestingly,
I&rsquo;m not aware that there&rsquo;s been very much inquiry into
it&mdash;or if there has been, I haven&rsquo;t heard about it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">39</font></sup>
But in the case of the one that everybody&rsquo;s excited
about&mdash;Kennedy&mdash;I mean, nobody&rsquo;s even come up with a
plausible <i>reason.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, that&rsquo;s
a pretty dramatic contrast, isn&rsquo;t it: the case of the King
assassination is on its face very plausible, and the case of the
Kennedy assassination is on its face extremely implausible&mdash;yet
look at the difference in treatment.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Do you
have any ideas why that might be?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there are a
lot of things in a way &ldquo;conspiring&rdquo; to make the Kennedy
assassination an attractive topic these days. I mean, the Kennedy
administration was in many ways very similar to the Reagan
administration&mdash;in policy and programs&mdash;but they did do one
smart thing that was different: they sort of buttered up the
intellectual class, as compared with the Reaganites, who just treated
them with contempt. So they gave sort of an <i>appearance</i> of
sharing power (it was never real) to the kinds of people who write
books and articles, and make movies, and all of those things&mdash;and
the result is, Camelot has always had a very beautiful image. And
somehow it&rsquo;s all succeeded in getting most of the population to
believe the lies about Kennedy. I mean, even today you can go down to
poor rural black areas in the South and find pictures of him on the
walls. Kennedy&rsquo;s role in the Civil Rights Movement was not
pretty. But somehow the imagery has succeeded, even if the reality
was never there.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">40</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And certainly a lot
of things have gone wrong in the last thirty years, for all sorts of
independent reasons. I mean, the Civil Rights Movement made great
achievements, but it never lived up to the hopes that many people
invested in it. The anti-war movement made achievements, but it
didn&rsquo;t end war. Real wages have been declining for twenty
years.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">41</font></sup>
People are working harder, they have to work longer hours, they have
less security&mdash;things are just looking bad for a lot of people,
especially young people. I mean, very few people expect the future
for their children to be anything like what they had, and entry-level
wages in the United States have just declined radically in the last
fifteen years&mdash;for instance, wages you get for your first job
after high school are now down 30 percent for males and 18 percent
for females over 1980, and that just kind of changes your picture of
life.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">42</font></sup> And
one  could easily go on. But the fact is, a lot of things have
happened that aren&rsquo;t very pretty. And in this kind of
situation, it&rsquo;s very easy to fall into the belief that we had a
hero, and we had a wonderful country, and we had this guy who was
going to lead us, we had the messiah&mdash;then they shot him down
and ever since then everything&rsquo;s been illegitimate. So really
there have to be serious efforts to get past this, I think.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8752_2032848809"></a>The
Decision to Get Involved<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam, we&rsquo;ve
been discussing a number of activist strategies and problems&mdash;I&rsquo;d
like to talk for a moment about some of the reasons why people don&rsquo;t
get involved in activism. Suppose somebody convinced you, at the
level of your belief in most things, that it was impossible to change
the country, that the basic institutional structures we have now are
going to remain in place for the next 200 years&mdash;you know, more
or less adapted, but the same basic structures. I&rsquo;m wondering,
would you behave any differently?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Zero.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You would
behave exactly the same way?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Same way. In fact,
you don&rsquo;t even have to make it hypothetical&mdash;when I first
got seriously involved in anti-Vietnam War activity, I was a hundred
percent convinced that absolutely nothing could be done. I mean, into
1965 and &rsquo;66, if we wanted to have an anti-war meeting in
Boston, we&rsquo;d have to find six topics&mdash;you know, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
talk about Venezuela, Iran, Vietnam, and the price of bread, and
maybe we can get an audience that&rsquo;ll outnumber the organizers.&rdquo;
And that went on for a long time. It looked impossible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: So if you
thought that the current situation was going to continue, just
persist forever, you would still do it?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Why,
exactly?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, for a number
of quite simple reasons. For one thing, if somebody convinced me of
that, it would be because I&rsquo;m totally irrational&mdash;there&rsquo;s
no <i>way</i> to convince anybody of such things rationally. Look, we
cannot predict the weather two weeks ahead, and that&rsquo;s
something relatively simple, it&rsquo;s not like human society.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: It&rsquo;s a
hypothetical question, it gets to motivations&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure
none of us believe it, none of us believe you could prove it . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Not only could you
not prove it, you couldn&rsquo;t even say anything convincing about
it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But,
nevertheless, because in fact a great many people not understanding
that point do feel this way, or tend to feel this way sometimes, and
get depressed at those moments&mdash;what I&rsquo;m wondering is,
anyway, in any event, what gets you up each morning to do the things
you do? Is it that you think in terms of winning a little way down
the road, or is it something else?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it&rsquo;s
hard to introspect, but to the extent that I introspect about it,
it&rsquo;s because you basically have two choices. One choice is to
assume the worst, and then you can be guaranteed that it&rsquo;ll
happen. The other is to assume that there&rsquo;s some hope for
change, in which case it&rsquo;s possible that you can help to effect
change. So you&rsquo;ve got two choices, one guarantees the worst
will happen, the other leaves open the possibility that things might
get better. Given those choices, a decent person doesn&rsquo;t
hesitate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But is it
really true that a decent person will only go that one way? I&rsquo;m
remembering a friend of mine who was an activist in the Sixties and
intended to move into a working-class neighborhood to do organizing,
and finally he decided not to. Somewhat later he went back to
graduate school and became a psychiatrist, and now I&rsquo;m sure he
has progressive values, but he&rsquo;s certainly not involved in any
significant way in political activity. But the choice he made back
then was a very conscious one: he looked around and said, &ldquo;The
impact that I personally am going to have is so small, because I&rsquo;m
not So-and-so and So-and-so, that I feel it&rsquo;s just not worth
giving up what I think I&rsquo;ll be giving up.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I know plenty of
people like that too. But see, that person now, let&rsquo;s say he&rsquo;s
a rich psychiatrist somewhere&mdash;okay, he&rsquo;s got a lot of
options, he&rsquo;s simply deciding at some point not to face them.
They&rsquo;re always there. For example, he&rsquo;s got money: if he
doesn&rsquo;t want to do things himself, he can give money to people
who do. In fact, movement groups have existed because people who were
doing other things were willing to fund them&mdash;something as
trivial as that. And you can go way beyond that, of course, and still
live your elegant lifestyle and do the work you want to do. I know
plenty of people who have in fact divided their lives that way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, of course, it&rsquo;s
extremely easy to say, &ldquo;The heck with it&mdash;I&rsquo;m just
going to adapt myself to the structures of power and authority, and
do the best I can within them.&rdquo; Sure, you can do that. But
that&rsquo;s not acting like a decent person. Look, if you&rsquo;re
walking down the street and you see a kid eating an ice-cream cone,
and you notice there&rsquo;s no cop around and you&rsquo;re hungry,
you can take the ice-cream cone because you&rsquo;re bigger and just
walk away. You can do that&mdash;probably there are people who do.
But we  call them pathological. On the other hand, if they do it
within existing social structures, we call them normal&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
just as pathological, it&rsquo;s just the pathology of the general
society.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Again, people always
have choices, so you can decide to accept the pathology&mdash;but
then do it honestly at least. If you have that grain of honesty in
you, say: &ldquo;Okay, I&rsquo;m going to honestly be pathological.&rdquo;
Or else just try to break out of it somehow.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: For a lot of
people, though, it appears that there&rsquo;s an all-or-nothing
choice&mdash;it appears that there&rsquo;s the choice between being
&ldquo;normal,&rdquo; pathological as you describe, but a normal
member of society with its normal benefits and costs, having a
reasonably average or perhaps elite existence, one that&rsquo;s
accepted. And then there seems to be the &ldquo;all&rdquo; choice. I
think the reason why it&rsquo;s so hard for people even just to take
a leaflet, or to give a donation at a relatively low level which
means nothing to them financially&mdash;which is less money than
they&rsquo;re going to spend on dinner Friday night when they go
out&mdash;seems to me to be because there is this psychologically
very powerful effect. At some level people know that it&rsquo;s
right, but they also know that to do it somewhat leads to doing it
more&mdash;so they just close the door right at the very beginning.
I&rsquo;m not sure how as organizers we can manage to overcome that
situation.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think you&rsquo;re
right that just giving your contribution of a hundred dollars to the
Central America Support Center or whatever is a statement that you
know that that&rsquo;s the right thing to do&mdash;and then once
you&rsquo;ve stated that it&rsquo;s the right thing to do, the
question arises, &ldquo;How come I&rsquo;m only doing this when I
could be doing a million times more?&rdquo; And it&rsquo;s very easy
just to say, &ldquo;Look, I&rsquo;m not going to face that problem,
I&rsquo;m just going to forget it all.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s like
stealing the ice-cream cone from the kid.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The reality is that
there&rsquo;s a whole range of choices in the middle, and all of us
have made them&mdash;none of us are saints, at least I&rsquo;m not. I
haven&rsquo;t given up my house, I haven&rsquo;t given up my car, I
don&rsquo;t live in a hovel, I don&rsquo;t spend 24 hours a day
working for the benefit of the human race, or anything like that. In
fact, I don&rsquo;t even come close: I spend an awful lot of my time
and energy just doing scientific work.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: And you
don&rsquo;t feel guilty about that.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
not so clear. But I certainly do devote an awful lot of my energy and
activity to things that I just enjoy, like scientific work. I just
like it, I do it out of pleasure. And everybody else I know does the
same thing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>AN: Do you fool
yourself into believing that it increases your effectiveness as a
political person somehow?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No, that&rsquo;s
ridiculous&mdash;it has no effect on that. And I certainly don&rsquo;t
do it for that reason. I do it because I like it, and I think it&rsquo;s
getting somewhere.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, you&rsquo;re
not going to be effective as a political activist unless you have a
satisfying life. I mean, there <i>may</i> be people who are really
saints, but I&rsquo;ve never heard of one. Like, it may be that the
political activities themselves are so gratifying that they&rsquo;re
all you want to do, and you just throw yourself into them. Okay,
that&rsquo;s a perfectly fine thing to be&mdash;it&rsquo;s just that
most people have other interests: they want to listen to music, they
want to take a walk by the ocean, they want to watch the sunset. Any
human being is too rich and complex just to be satisfied with these
things, so you have to hit some kind of a balance.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the choices
are all there, but I think you&rsquo;ve identified precisely why it&rsquo;s
psychologically difficult for people to recognize that&mdash;because
once you&rsquo;ve recognized that the choices are there, you&rsquo;re
always going to be faced with the question, why am I not doing more?
But that&rsquo;s just the reality of life: if you&rsquo;re honest,
you&rsquo;re always going to be faced with that question. And there
are plenty of things to do, and also plenty of successes to point to.
In fact, it&rsquo;s <i>amazing</i> how many successes there have
been, if you really think about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For example, take
the issue of East Timor, a big massacre. At the time that I got
involved in that over a decade ago, nobody even wanted to hear about
it&mdash;but after years of organizing by some pretty tireless
activists, things finally got to the point where the U.S. Congress
barred military aid to Indonesia. That&rsquo;s a tremendous
change&mdash;you could save hundreds of thousands of lives that way.
How many people can look back and say, &ldquo;Look, I helped to save
hundreds of thousands of lives&rdquo;? And that&rsquo;s one tiny
issue. So all of it was going on in secret, nobody was interested,
everybody in power wanted to let it go on&mdash;but half a dozen or
so people finally managed to break through.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I&rsquo;m
inclined to think that most of the people who are involved in that
effort, instead of feeling elated, or at least feeling a degree of
satisfaction over the accomplishment, rather view it as a
horrendously long campaign with very little achieved over the years.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Suppose you&rsquo;re
on your deathbed: how many people can look back and say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
contributed to helping <i>one</i> person not get killed&rdquo;?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I&rsquo;m
not disagreeing with you&mdash;but there&rsquo;s just something about
our culture that causes people on the left not to see the successes.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, I&rsquo;m not
so convinced of this. If you go back to the 1960s movements, when a
lot of the current ferment started, the people involved
overwhelmingly were young people&mdash;and young people have a
notoriously short perspective. That&rsquo;s part of being twenty
years old: you&rsquo;re thinking  about what&rsquo;s going to happen
tomorrow, not what life is going to be like twenty years from now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So look at something
like the Columbia strike, which was the big thing in 1968 [hundreds
of students took over Columbia University buildings for eight days to
protest war-related research and the school&rsquo;s relations with
the surrounding community]. If you remember what it was like back
then, you&rsquo;ll recall that the sense on the Columbia campus&mdash;quite
literally, I&rsquo;m not exaggerating&mdash;was: &ldquo;If we close
down Columbia and have fun smoking pot for three weeks, the
revolution will be here, and then it&rsquo;ll all be over and
everybody will be happy and equal and free, and we can go back to our
ordinary concerns.&rdquo; Well, you waited three weeks, the cops came
in and smashed you up, and nothing changed. And there were a lot of
results from that. One result was just that a lot of people gave up,
said, &ldquo;Well, we couldn&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; In fact, it&rsquo;s
rather striking that &rsquo;68 around the world is considered a
crucially important date&mdash;but it was really the end.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the fact that it
was dominantly a youth movement in the Sixties had good and bad
aspects, and one bad aspect was this sense that if you don&rsquo;t
achieve quickly, you&rsquo;d might as well quit. But of course,
that&rsquo;s not the way changes come. The struggle against slavery
went on forever, the struggle for women&rsquo;s rights has been going
on for centuries, the effort to overcome &ldquo;wage slavery&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s
been going on since the beginnings of the industrial revolution, we
haven&rsquo;t advanced an inch. In fact, we&rsquo;re worse off than
we were a hundred years ago in terms of understanding the issues.
Well, okay, you just keep struggling.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8754_2032848809"></a>&ldquo;Human
Nature Is Corrupt&rdquo;<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Noam,
another view I frequently encounter lying behind people&rsquo;s
reticence to become involved in political activity stems from the
idea that human nature is corrupt: egotistical, self-centered,
anti-social, and so on&mdash;and that as a result, society will
always have oppressors and oppressed, be hierarchical, exploit
people, be driven by individual self-interest, etc. I often find that
you can get agreement on the inhumanity of the system, or on the
injustice of a war, or on some specific set of policies, but that
people will refrain from becoming active about it because of a sense
of hopelessness having to do with this view of human nature. Again,
it may just be an excuse, a last line of defense against getting
involved&mdash;but in order to deal with it as an organizer, you
still have to address the claim. I&rsquo;m curious what you would say
to someone like that.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there&rsquo;s
a sense in which the claim is certainly true. First of all, human
nature is something we don&rsquo;t know much about: doubtless there
is a rich and complex human nature, and doubtless it&rsquo;s largely
genetically determined, like everything else&mdash;but we don&rsquo;t
know what it is. However,  there is enough evidence from history and
experience to demonstrate that human nature is entirely consistent
with everything you mentioned&mdash;in fact, by definition it has to
be. So we know that human nature, and that includes our nature, yours
and mine, can very easily turn people into quite efficient torturers
and mass-murderers and slave-drivers. We know that&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
have to look very far for evidence. But what does that mean? Should
people therefore not try to stop torture? If you see somebody beating
a child to death, should you say, &ldquo;Well, you know, that&rsquo;s
human nature&rdquo;&mdash;which it is in fact: there certainly are
conditions under which people will act like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">To the extent that
the statement is true, and there is such an extent, it&rsquo;s just
not relevant: human nature also has the capacity to lead to
selflessness, and cooperation, and sacrifice, and support, and
solidarity, and tremendous courage, and lots of other things too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, my general
feeling is that over time, there&rsquo;s measurable progress&mdash;it&rsquo;s
not huge, but it&rsquo;s significant. And sometimes it&rsquo;s been
pretty dramatic. Over history, there&rsquo;s been a real widening of
the moral realm, I think&mdash;a recognition of broader and broader
domains of individuals who are regarded as moral agents, meaning
having rights. Look, we are self-conscious beings, we&rsquo;re not
rocks, and we can come to get a better understanding of our own
nature, it can become more and more realized over time&mdash;not
because you read a book about it, the book doesn&rsquo;t have
anything to tell you, because nobody really knows anything about this
topic. But just through experience&mdash;including historical
experience, which is part of our personal experience because it&rsquo;s
embedded in the culture we enter into&mdash;we can gain greater
understanding of our nature and values.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8756_2032848809"></a>Discovering
Morality<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Take the treatment
of children, for example. In the medieval period, it was considered
quite legitimate to either kill them, or throw them out, or treat
them brutally, all sorts of things. It still happens of course, but
now it&rsquo;s regarded as pathological, not proper. Well, it&rsquo;s
not that we have a different moral <i>capacity</i> than people did in
the Middle Ages, it&rsquo;s just that the situation&rsquo;s changed:
there are opportunities to think about things that weren&rsquo;t
available in a society that had a lower material production level and
so on. So we&rsquo;ve just learned more about our own moral sense in
that area.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think it&rsquo;s
part of moral progress to be able to face things that once looked as
if they weren&rsquo;t problems. I have that kind of feeling about our
relation to animals, for example&mdash;I think the questions there
are hard, in fact. A lot of these things are matters of trying to
explore your own moral intuitions, and if you&rsquo;ve never explored
them, you don&rsquo;t know what they are. Abortion&rsquo;s a similar
case&mdash;there are complicated moral issues. Feminist issues were a
similar case. Slavery was a similar case. I mean, some of these
things seem easy now, because we&rsquo;ve solved them and there&rsquo;s
a kind of  shared consensus&mdash;but I think it&rsquo;s a very good
thing that people are asking questions these days about, say, animal
rights. I think there are serious questions there. Like, to what
extent do we have a right to experiment on and torture animals? I
mean, yes, you want to do animal experimentation for the prevention
of diseases. But what&rsquo;s the balance, where&rsquo;s the
trade-off? There&rsquo;s obviously got to be some. Like, we&rsquo;d
all agree that too much torture of animals for treating a disease
would not be permissible. But what are the principles on which we
draw such conclusions? That&rsquo;s not a trivial question.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: What about
eating?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Same question.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Are you a
vegetarian?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I&rsquo;m not, but I
think it&rsquo;s a serious question. If you want my guess, my guess
is that if society continues to develop without catastrophe on
something like the course you can see over time, I wouldn&rsquo;t in
the least be surprised if it moves in the direction of vegetarianism
and the protection of animal rights.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, doubtless
there&rsquo;s plenty of hypocrisy and confusion and everything else
about the question right now, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the
issue isn&rsquo;t valid. And I think one can see the moral force to
it&mdash;definitely one should keep an open mind on it, it&rsquo;s
certainly a perfectly intelligible idea to us.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, you don&rsquo;t
have to go back very far in history to find <i>gratuitous</i> torture
of animals. So in Cartesian philosophy, they thought they&rsquo;d
proven that humans had minds and everything else in the world was a
machine&mdash;so there&rsquo;s no difference between a cat and a
watch, let&rsquo;s say, just the cat&rsquo;s a little more
complicated. And if you look back at the French Court in the
seventeenth century, courtiers&mdash;you know, big smart guys who&rsquo;d
studied all this stuff and thought they understood it&mdash;would as
a sport take Lady So-And-So&rsquo;s favorite dog and kick it and beat
it to death, and laugh, saying, &ldquo;Ha, ha, look, this silly lady
doesn&rsquo;t understand the latest philosophy, which shows that it&rsquo;s
just like dropping a rock on the floor.&rdquo; That was <i>gratuitous</i>
torture of animals, and it was regarded as if it were the torturing
of a rock: you can&rsquo;t do it, there&rsquo;s no way to torture a
rock. Well, the moral sphere has certainly changed in that
respect&mdash;gratuitous torture of animals is no longer considered
quite legitimate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: But in that
case it could be that what&rsquo;s changed is our understanding of
what an animal is, not the understanding of our underlying values.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In that case it
probably was&mdash;because in fact the Cartesian view was a departure
from the traditional view, in which you didn&rsquo;t torture animals
gratuitously. On the other hand, there are cultures, like say,
aristocratic cultures, that have fox-hunting as a sport, or
bear-baiting, or other things like that, in which gratuitous torture
of animals has been seen as perfectly legitimate.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, it&rsquo;s
kind of intriguing to see how we regard this. Take cock-fighting, for
example, in which cocks are trained to tear each other to shreds. Our
culture happens to regard that as barbaric; on the other hand, we
train humans to tear each other to shreds&mdash;they&rsquo;re called
boxing matches&mdash;and that&rsquo;s <i>not</i> regarded as
barbaric. So there are things that we don&rsquo;t permit of cocks
that we permit of poor people. Well, you know, there are some funny
values at work there.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p align="center" style="margin-top: 0.3in; margin-bottom: 0.23in; line-height: 115%">
<font size="5" style="font-size: 17pt"><b><i>Abortion</i> </b></font>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: You
mentioned abortion&mdash;what&rsquo;s your view about that whole
debate?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I think it&rsquo;s a
hard one, I don&rsquo;t think the answers are simple&mdash;it&rsquo;s
a case where there really are conflicting values. See, it&rsquo;s
very rare in most human situations that there&rsquo;s a clear and
simple answer about what&rsquo;s right, and sometimes the answers are
very murky, because there are different values, and values do
conflict. I mean, our understanding of our own moral value system is
that it&rsquo;s not like an axiom system, where there&rsquo;s always
one answer and not some other answer. Rather we have what appear to
be conflicting values, which often lead us to different answers&mdash;maybe
because we don&rsquo;t understand all the values well enough yet, or
maybe because they really are in conflict. Well, in the case of
abortion, there are just straight conflicts. From one point of view,
a child up to a certain point is an organ of the mother&rsquo;s body,
and the mother ought to have a decision what to do&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
true. From another point of view, the organism is a potential human
being, and it has rights. And those two values are simply in
conflict.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand, a
biologist I know once suggested that we may one day be able to see
the same conflict when a woman washes her hands. I mean, when a woman
washes her hands, a lot of cells flake off&mdash;and in principle,
each of those cells has the genetic instructions for a human being.
Well, you could imagine a future technology which would take one of
those cells and create a human being from it. Now, obviously he was
making the argument as a reductio ad absurdum argument, but there&rsquo;s
an element of truth to it&mdash;not that much yet, but it&rsquo;s not
like saying something about astrology. What he&rsquo;s saying is
true.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you want to know
my own personal judgment, I would say a reasonable proposal at this
point is that the fetus changes from an organ to a person when it
becomes viable&mdash;but certainly that&rsquo;s arguable. And
besides, as this biologist was pointing out, it&rsquo;s not very
clear when that is&mdash;depending  on the state of technology, it
could be when the woman&rsquo;s washing her hands. That&rsquo;s life,
though: in life you&rsquo;re faced with hard decisions, conflicting
values.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8758_2032848809"></a>Moral
Values<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Where do you
think &ldquo;values&rdquo; come from in the first place?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s an
interesting question. Any answer we give is based on extremely little
understanding, so nothing one says is very serious. But just from the
conditions of moral judgment, I don&rsquo;t see how it can fail to be
true that moral values are basically rooted in our nature&mdash;I
think that must be true. And the reason why I say that is pretty
elementary.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, undoubtedly
the way in which we look at things and make judgments about them and
assess them has a significant and notable cultural factor. But that
aside, we certainly are capable, and everybody does it, of making
moral judgments and evaluations in entirely <i>new</i> situations&mdash;we
do that all the time; we may not be <i>consciously</i> evaluating all
the new circumstances we&rsquo;re faced with, but we&rsquo;re
certainly at least tacitly doing it, and the results of those
evaluations are the basis for our choices of action, our doing one
thing and not another. So we&rsquo;re constantly making all kinds of
judgments, including moral judgments, aesthetic judgments, and all
sorts of others, about new things and new situations. Well, either
it&rsquo;s being done just randomly, sort of like pulling something
out of a hat&mdash;which certainly doesn&rsquo;t seem to be true,
either introspectively or by observation&mdash;or else we&rsquo;re
doing it on the basis of some moral system that we have built into
our minds somehow, which gives answers, or at least partial answers,
to a whole range of new situations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, nobody knows
what that system actually <i>is</i> of course&mdash;we don&rsquo;t
understand it at all&mdash;but it does seem to be rich and complex
enough so that it can apply to indefinitely many new situations.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Obviously
one couldn&rsquo;t map it out in detail, but how do you think such a
system might be set up?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, again, we
really don&rsquo;t know at all. But a serious proposal for such a
system, I think, would be that it might be something like what we
know about language&mdash;and a lot is known. For example, there is a
framework of basic, fundamental principles of language that are
invariant in the species, they&rsquo;re just fixed in our biological
nature somehow&mdash;they hold for all languages, and they allow for
only a very limited degree of modification, which comes from early
experience. Then as soon as those wired-in options for variation are
fixed, children have a whole linguistic system which allows them to
say new things, and to understand new things, and to interpret  new
expressions that nobody&rsquo;s ever heard before&mdash;all kinds of
things like that.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, qualitatively
speaking, that&rsquo;s what our system of moral judgment looks like,
so it&rsquo;s conceivable that it has a similar kind of basis&mdash;but
again, you have to find the answer, you can&rsquo;t just guess.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Obviously
the underlying principles can&rsquo;t be simple&mdash;they can&rsquo;t
just be something like, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">No&mdash;because we
decide much more complex things than that. I mean, we really don&rsquo;t
know what the fundamental principles of moral judgment actually <i>are</i>,
but we have very good reason to believe that they&rsquo;re <i>there.</i>
And that&rsquo;s simply because we can, in fact, make relatively
consistent moral judgments, judgments which are understood by other
people, and appreciated by them (sometimes with disagreement, in
which case we can have moral discourse), and we can do all of that
under new conditions that we&rsquo;ve never seen before, and facing
new problems and so on. Okay, unless we&rsquo;re angels, the
structures that perform those functions got into the organism the
same way other complex things did&mdash;namely, they&rsquo;re largely
part of a genetically-determined framework, which gets marginally
modified through the course probably of early experience.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
what our moral system might look like. How much variation can there
be in such moral systems? Well, without understanding, we don&rsquo;t
know. How much variation can there be in languages? Without
understanding, we don&rsquo;t know. I mean, in the case of languages,
we know that it&rsquo;s not much variation, and in the case of moral
values I think we can make a fair guess that it also can&rsquo;t be
much variation&mdash;and the reason is quite elementary. Our moral
system appears to be complex and determinate, and there are only two
factors that can enter into determining it: one is our fixed
biological nature, and the other is individual experience. Well, we
know that experience is extremely impoverished, it doesn&rsquo;t give
a lot of direction&mdash;the logic being pretty much the same as when
someone asks, &ldquo;Why do children undergo puberty at a certain
age?&rdquo; Actually, nobody knows the answer to that: it&rsquo;s a
topic that&rsquo;s unknown. But there are only two possible factors
that can enter into it. One is something in children&rsquo;s
pre-puberty experience which sort of sets them off undergoing
puberty&mdash;say, some effect of the environment such as peer
pressure, or somebody told you it would be a good idea or something.
And the other is that we&rsquo;re just genetically designed so that
under certain conditions and at a certain level of maturation,
hormones take over, and at that point we undergo puberty: it&rsquo;s
wired in.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, without
knowing anything, everyone just assumes the second possibility. Like,
if somebody came along and said they think it&rsquo;s peer pressure
that causes puberty&mdash;it&rsquo;s because you see other people
doing it, and you want to be like them&mdash;without knowing
anything, you&rsquo;d just laugh. And  the reason you&rsquo;d laugh
is very simple: the environment is not specific enough or rich enough
to determine these highly specific changes that take place. And that
logic also holds for just about everything else in growth and
development too&mdash;that&rsquo;s why people assume, without
knowledge, that an embryo will become a chicken rather than a human
being depending on its biological nature, not depending on the
nutrition that&rsquo;s fed in: because the nutrition doesn&rsquo;t
have enough information to cause those highly specific changes. Well,
it looks as if moral values and our moral judgment system are of that
character too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually,
contributing to this conclusion is just the fact that we can <i>have</i>
moral discourse to begin with. So take an issue on which people were
really split, take slavery. It wasn&rsquo;t just an intellectual
debate, obviously&mdash;there was a huge amount of struggle
involved&mdash;but insofar as there <i>was</i> an intellectual
debate, it had a certain shared moral ground to it. In fact, the
slave owners&rsquo; arguments are not so simple to answer&mdash;some
of them are valid, and have a lot of implications. They were taken
very seriously by American workers in the late nineteenth century,
for example.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For instance, the
slave owners argued, &ldquo;You take better care of a slave if you
own it than if you rent it.&rdquo; Like, you take better care of your
car if you own it than if you rent it, so you take better care of
your worker if you own it than if you rent it&mdash;so slavery&rsquo;s
benevolent and &ldquo;free market&rdquo; is morally atrocious. And
the slave owners in fact said, &ldquo;Look, we&rsquo;re a lot more
benevolent than you guys with your capitalist wage-slave system.&rdquo;
And if you look back at the literature by workers who organized into,
say, the Knights of Labor and other working-class organizations of
the late nineteenth century, you&rsquo;ll also see a strain running
through their position which said: &ldquo;We fought to <i>end</i>
slavery, not to impose it&rdquo; [i.e. the industrial wage-labor
system became dominant after the Civil War].<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">43</font></sup>
So the point is, on all sides of debates like these, people
understand that they have to appeal to the same basic moral
principles, even if what they&rsquo;re doing is totally venal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, it&rsquo;s
extremely rare even for an S.S. guard or a torturer to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
doing this because I like to be a son of a bitch.&rdquo; We all do
bad things in our lives, and if you think back, it&rsquo;s very rare
that you&rsquo;ve said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing this just because I
feel like it&rdquo;&mdash;people reinterpret things in order to fit
them into a basic framework of moral values, which in fact we all
share.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, I don&rsquo;t
want to suggest that moral values are <i>uniform</i>&mdash;if you
look across cultures, you do find some differences. But when you look
at different languages, you also appear to find radical differences.
You know they can&rsquo;t be there&mdash;because if the differences
<i>really</i> were great, it would be impossible to acquire any of
the languages. So therefore the differences have to be superficial,
and the scientific question is to prove what must be true by the
basic logic of the situation. Well, I think the same must be true in
the case of moral judgment as well. So to go back to the original
question, I don&rsquo;t think we can reasonably doubt that moral
values are indeed rooted in our nature.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Then if
people do have this shared set of moral values, you still have to
explain why everything is as corrupt and hierarchical and war-laden
as it is.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But why not ask
another question? Why not ask how come there&rsquo;s so much
sympathy, and care, and love, and solidarity? I mean, that&rsquo;s
also true.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: That&rsquo;s
the way I always answer the objection&mdash;there should be none of
those things, because the institutions don&rsquo;t breed them.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there&rsquo;s
no such thing as, &ldquo;why is there so much of this and so much of
that?&rdquo;&mdash;there is what there is. But what there is
doubtless is conditioned by the opportunities and choices that are
imposed and available to people under particular social, cultural,
economic, and even physical settings. So the point is to try to get
to a situation where the society and all its institutions and
arrangements are set up so as to maximize the options for people to
pursue the healthier alternatives. And I really don&rsquo;t think
there&rsquo;s been a better period in modern history for organizing
towards that than there is right now, actually.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, there&rsquo;s
tremendous disillusionment all across the country&mdash;and it&rsquo;s
world-wide incidentally: there have been cross-national studies of
this, and the level of pessimism across the entire industrial world
is just extraordinary. In the United States, for example, about
three-quarters of the population thinks that the future is going to
be &ldquo;objectively worse&rdquo; than the past&mdash;in other
words, that their children won&rsquo;t live like they do.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">44</font></sup>
About half the American population thinks that both political parties
just ought to be disbanded, they&rsquo;re useless.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">45</font></sup>
The disaffection from institutions is always high, and it&rsquo;s
been going up very consistently in past years.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">46</font></sup>
These are conditions under which organizing for social change ought
to be very much possible&mdash;if we&rsquo;re not doing it, it&rsquo;s
our own fault: these factors have not been true in the past.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But at the same
time, it&rsquo;s also true that people feel hopeless. I mean, part of
the disillusionment is that they just don&rsquo;t see anything
else&mdash;they don&rsquo;t see a solution, or any alternatives. Even
at the depths of the 1930s Depression, which was objectively much
worse than today, people were never hopeless the way they are today.
Most people felt it&rsquo;s going to get better, we can do something
about it, we can organize, we can work. I mean, they had illusions
too, like there were a lot of illusions about Roosevelt, for
example&mdash;but the illusions were combined with something real
going on. Today what people mainly feel is, it&rsquo;s going to get
worse, and there&rsquo;s nothing we can do about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So what we&rsquo;re
faced with is a combination of a very high degree of disillusionment,
and a very low degree of hope and perception of alternatives. And
that&rsquo;s exactly where serious organizers ought to be able to
step in.</p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: What would
have to happen for people to be able to do more of the real work of
society&mdash;like supporting each other and educating
children&mdash;instead of just spending our whole lives working at
lame jobs for corporations?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, a lot of
countries tend to emphasize those things, even today&mdash;we don&rsquo;t
have to look very far for models. For example, take Western Europe:
those are societies not very different from ours, they have the same
corporate-run economy, the same sort of limited political system, but
they just happen to pursue somewhat different social policies, for
various historical reasons. So Germany has a kind of social contract
we don&rsquo;t have&mdash;one of the biggest unions there just won a
35-hour work-week, for example.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">1</font></sup>
In the Netherlands, poverty among the elderly has gone down to flat
zero, and among children it&rsquo;s 4 percent, almost nothing.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">2</font></sup>
In Sweden, mothers and fathers both get substantial parental leave to
take care of their children, like a year or something&mdash;because
taking care of children is considered something that has value in
that society, unlike in the United States, where the leadership
elements <i>hate</i> families.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">3</font></sup>
I mean, Newt Gingrich and the rest of these people may <i>talk</i>
about supporting &ldquo;family values,&rdquo; but they actually want
families destroyed&mdash;because families are not rational from the
point of view of profit-making.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So even within the
range of existing societies set up almost exactly like ours, there
are plenty of other social policies you could have&mdash;and I think
our system could tolerate those things too, it really just depends if
there&rsquo;s enough pressure to achieve them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, you might
want to take a look at an interesting volume published  recently by
U.N.I.C.E.F. [the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund], about
treatment of children in the rich countries&mdash;it&rsquo;s yet to
be reviewed in the <i>New York Times</i>, or anywhere else in the
United States, but it&rsquo;s really quite revealing. It was written
by a very good American economist named Sylvia Ann Hewlett, and she
identifies two basic patterns of treatment, a
&ldquo;Continental-European/Japanese&rdquo; model and an
&ldquo;Anglo-American&rdquo; model&mdash;which just are radically
different. Her conclusion is, the Continental-European /Japanese
pattern has improved the status of children and families; the
Anglo-American pattern has been what she calls &ldquo;a war&rdquo;
against children and families. And that&rsquo;s particularly been
true in the last twenty years, because the so-called &ldquo;conservatives&rdquo;
who took over in the 1980s, aside from their love of torture and
misery abroad, also happen to be passionately opposed to family
values and the rights of children, and have carried out social
policies which have destroyed them.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">4</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
just the wrong story for the <i>New York Times</i>&mdash;so that
study never gets reviewed. Instead what the <i>Times</i> editors
devote the cover-story of their <i>Book Review</i> to is another
extremely deep problem the United States is facing&mdash;in case you
aren&rsquo;t aware of it, you&rsquo;d really better read this. We&rsquo;re
facing the problem that &ldquo;bad genes&rdquo; are taking over the
United States&mdash;and part of the proof of that is that scores on
S.A.T.s and I.Q. tests have been steadily declining in recent years,
children just aren&rsquo;t doing as well as they used to.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, somebody who&rsquo;s
really unsophisticated might think that the problem could have
something to do with social policies that have driven 40 percent of
the children in New York City below the poverty line, for example&mdash;but
that issue never arises for the <i>New York Times.</i><sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">5</font></sup>
Instead the problem is bad genes. The problem is that blacks, who
evolved in Africa, evolved in kind of a hostile climate, so therefore
they evolved in such a way that black mothers don&rsquo;t nurture
their children&mdash;and also they breed a lot, they all breed like
rabbits. And the effect is, the gene pool in the United States is
being contaminated, and now it&rsquo;s starting to show up in
standardized test scores.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">6</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This is real hard
science.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The <i>Times</i>&rsquo;s
review starts off by saying, well, maybe the facts in these books
aren&rsquo;t quite right, but nonetheless, one thing is clear: these
are serious issues, and any democratic society which ignores them
does so &ldquo;at its peril.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">7</font></sup>
On the other hand, a society doesn&rsquo;t ignore &ldquo;at its
peril&rdquo; social policies that are depriving 40 percent of the
children in New York City of the minimal material conditions which
would offer them any hope of ever escaping the misery, destitution
and violence that surround them, and which have driven them down to
levels of malnutrition, disease and suffering where you can predict
perfectly well what their scores are going to be on the &ldquo;I.Q.&rdquo;
tests you give them&mdash;none of that you even mention.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, according
to the last statistics I saw about this, 30 million people in the
United States are suffering hunger. 30 million is a lot of people,
you  know, and that means plenty of children.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">8</font></sup>
In the 1980s, hunger declined in general throughout the entire world,
with two exceptions: sub-Saharan Africa and the United States&mdash;the
poorest part of the world and the richest part of the world, <i>there</i>
hunger increased. And as a matter of fact, between 1985 and 1990,
hunger in the United States increased by <i>50 percent</i>&mdash;it
took a couple years for the Reagan &ldquo;reforms&rdquo; to start
taking hold, but by 1985 they were beginning to have their effects.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">9</font></sup>
And there is just overwhelming evidence, in case it&rsquo;s not
obvious from common sense, what the effects of this kind of
deprivation are on children&mdash;physically, emotionally, and
mentally. For one thing, it&rsquo;s well known that neural
development simply is reduced by low levels of nutrition, and lack of
nurturance in general. So when kids suffer malnutrition, it has
permanent effects on them, it has a permanent effect on their health
and lives and minds&mdash;they never get over it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">10</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the growing
hunger here isn&rsquo;t just among children&mdash;it&rsquo;s also
been increasing among the elderly, to name one group. So as the <i>Wall
Street Journal</i> recently pointed out in a front-page story, hunger
is &ldquo;surging&rdquo; among the elderly: about five million older
Americans, about 16 percent of the population over 60, are going
hungry, they&rsquo;re malnourished, many of them are literally
starving to death.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">11</font></sup>
Now, in the United States we don&rsquo;t have starvation the way they
do in Haiti or Nicaragua or something&mdash;but the deprivation is
still very real. In many places it&rsquo;s probably worse than it is
in Cuba, say, under the embargo.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So just take Boston,
for example, where I live&mdash;which is a very rich city, and also
maybe the world&rsquo;s leading medical center. There are some very
fancy hospitals there, but there&rsquo;s also a City Hospital, which
serves the rest of the population. Well, that hospital, which is not
a bad hospital I should say, established a malnutrition clinic a few
years ago&mdash;because after the impact of the Reaganite economic
policies began to be felt, they were starting to find Third World
levels of malnutrition in Boston. And it gets worse over the winter,
because then families have to make the choice: do you let your kids
starve, or do you let them die of the cold? Okay? That&rsquo;s in one
of the richest cities in the world, a major medical center. That&rsquo;s
just criminal in a country as rich as this&mdash;or anywhere, for
that matter.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">12</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And it&rsquo;s not
just hunger: it turns out that contact time between parents and
children has declined by about 40 percent in the United States since
the 1960s&mdash;that means that on average, parents and children have
to spend about 10 or 12 hours less time together a week.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">13</font></sup>
Alright, the effects of that also are obvious: it means television as
supervision, latch-key kids, more violence by children and against
children, drug abuse&mdash;it&rsquo;s all perfectly predictable. And
this is mostly the result of the fact that today, <i>both</i> parents
in a family have to put in 50- or 60-hour work-weeks, with no
child-support system around to help them (unlike in other countries),
just to make ends meet.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">14</font></sup>
And remember, this is in the 1990s, a period when, as <i>Fortune</i>
magazine just pointed out, corporate profits are at a record high,
and the percentage  of corporate income going into payrolls is near a
record low&mdash;that&rsquo;s the context in which all of this has
been happening.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">15</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, none of these
things are discussed in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> article
either. They <i>are</i> discussed in the U.N.I.C.E.F. book I
mentioned, but the <i>Times</i> chose not to review that one.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So to return to your
question, you ask: what would have to happen for us to get social
policies different from all of these? I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s
any reason why the &ldquo;Anglo-American model&rdquo; Hewlett
identifies has to continue&mdash;and be extended by things like the
Contract With America [a Republican Congressional policy platform
launched in 1994] and the Welfare Reform Act [the &ldquo;Federal
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act,&rdquo;
which President Clinton signed in August 1996]. These aren&rsquo;t
laws of nature, after all; they&rsquo;re social-policy decisions&mdash;they
can be made differently. There&rsquo;s a lot of space for changing
these things, even in a society with the same corporate control as
ours.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But why not ask
another question. Why not ask why absolutist organizations have any
right to exist in the first place? I mean, why should a
corporation&mdash;technically a fascist organization of enormous
power&mdash;have any right to tell you what kind of work you&rsquo;re
going to do? Why is that any better than having a king tell you what
kind of work you&rsquo;re going to do? People fought against that and
overthrew it, and we can fight against it again and overthrow it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">There&rsquo;s plenty
of challenging, gratifying, interesting, productive work around for
people to do, and there are plenty of people who want to do it&mdash;they
simply aren&rsquo;t being allowed that opportunity under the current
economic system. Of course, there&rsquo;s also plenty of junky work
that has to get done too&mdash;but in a reasonable society, that work
would just be distributed equally among everybody capable of doing
it. If you can&rsquo;t get robots to do it, fine, then you just
distribute it equally.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">16</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Okay, I think that&rsquo;s
the kind of model we have to try to work towards now&mdash;and
frankly, I don&rsquo;t see any reason why that&rsquo;s an impossible
goal.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Mr.
Chomsky, I just wanted to say that I saw the New York Times review
you were discussing, and I was absolutely appalled by it. If I was a
black man in this country, I wouldn&rsquo;t know what to do with
myself&mdash;it would just be a burning fire inside, I would feel
such rage.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">How about if you
were a black woman? That article took seriously the idea that black
women don&rsquo;t nurture their children&mdash;because they evolved
in Africa, where the environment was such-and-such. It was pure
racism, something straight out of the Nazis.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But look: it&rsquo;s
really not even worth talking about it. The right way to respond is
just to ask, what are they doing it for? And they&rsquo;re doing it
for a very simple reason. 30 million people in the country go hungry.
40 percent of the children in New York City, most of them black and
Hispanic, live  below the poverty line&mdash;which means they&rsquo;re
destroyed, okay? And that is the result of very definite social
policies that these people are supporting. Well, you want to keep
making all your money, but you don&rsquo;t want to face any of the
rest of it, so you need some kind of a cover. And what&rsquo;s the
cover? &ldquo;Bad genes.&rdquo; Okay, once you understand what&rsquo;s
really motivating all of this, then at least you&rsquo;re in a
position to deal with it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The point is, just
as it was proper at some point for the Nazis to say, &ldquo;Jews are
a virus that&rsquo;s destroying our society,&rdquo; it is now proper
for the <i>New York Times</i> to run articles taking seriously the
idea that black mothers don&rsquo;t nurture their children, and for
the mainstream intellectual culture to pretend that these farcical
books on I.Q. have any kind of scientific legitimacy.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">17</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But these are such
transparent ideological weapons we shouldn&rsquo;t even waste our
time arguing about them. We should just understand them transparently
for what they are: the product of a real commissar culture that is
dedicated to obscuring the most elementary truths about the world,
and rich, powerful people trying to justify the fact that they are
pursuing social policies which are forcing children to die. It&rsquo;s
understandable why nobody would want to face that&mdash;but it&rsquo;s
also clear how we can change it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8762_2032848809"></a>Welfare:

</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: You
mentioned the &ldquo;Contract With America&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Welfare
Reform Act&rdquo; [which replaced the Aid for Families With Dependent
Children program, ending receipt of public assistance benefits by
families that include an adult who has received welfare for five
years, and requiring all &ldquo;able-bodied&rdquo; adult recipients
to secure a job within two years]. I&rsquo;m wondering, how do you
explain the surge to the right in Washington over the past several
years, beginning with the Republicans&rsquo; big Congressional
triumph in 1994? And what do you think is the real point of these new
programs?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, let me just
begin with the 1994 elections, and the so-called &ldquo;Contract With
America.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re right that in the media that whole
election was called a &ldquo;landslide for conservatism&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;political earthquake&rdquo; and so on&mdash;but you really
have to look at that kind of rhetoric a lot more carefully. There was
an interesting fact about the Republicans&rsquo; agenda, the
so-called &ldquo;Contract With America&rdquo;&mdash;that is, only a
very small number of voters even knew what it was, and when people
were asked about most of its specific provisions, big majorities
opposed it. So there was never really a vote on it, nobody knew what
it was. And even after months of intensive and unremitting propaganda
about it, less than half of the U.S. population said they had even
<i>heard</i> of the Contract With America.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">18</font></sup>
And it wasn&rsquo;t hidden, it was in the headlines every day. <i>That&rsquo;s</i>
the &ldquo;landslide for conservatism.&rdquo; And that&rsquo;s just a
way of saying that democracy has collapsed.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As far as what it&rsquo;s
been about, that couldn&rsquo;t be more obvious: it&rsquo;s standard
free-market doctrine&mdash;huge state-subsidies for the rich, cut out
everything for the poor. Very brazen. So just take a look at some of
the specific provisions. For example, they had one section in the
&ldquo;Contract&rdquo; called the &ldquo;Job Creation and Wage
Enhancement Act&rdquo;&mdash;the things under it were, subsidies to
business, tax cuts to business, and then there was one little line at
the bottom which said that the &ldquo;program to increase wages and
create jobs&rdquo; will be to eliminate &ldquo;unfunded mandates,&rdquo;
which are one of the main mechanisms to ensure that States do things
like provide social programs, set regulatory standards, and so on
[i.e. the &ldquo;mandates&rdquo; are imposed on state and local
governments by Congress].<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">19</font></sup>
Okay, that&rsquo;s the program to &ldquo;raise wages and create
jobs&rdquo;&mdash;and that&rsquo;s kind of like a symbol for the
whole thing.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The main target that
they&rsquo;ve gone after, both Clinton and Congress, is what&rsquo;s
called &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;&mdash;meaning that tiny component of
welfare that goes to poorer people, which is approximately the size
of a pea on a mountain. Meanwhile, they continue to enhance the <i>real</i>
welfare&mdash;that is, the mountain of welfare that goes to richer
people. And they&rsquo;re continuing to enhance it in the traditional
two ways: first, by straight handouts to business; and second,
through regressive fiscal measures [i.e. ones having a greater
adverse impact on those with less money].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So first take the
straight handouts part, which is the bulk of welfare. The straight
handouts part is things like military spending, for example. Now, the
United States isn&rsquo;t <i>defending</i> itself from anybody&mdash;that&rsquo;s
not even a joke. We have almost half the military spending in the
world, and who&rsquo;s attacking us?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">20</font></sup>
The United States hasn&rsquo;t been attacked since the War of
1812&mdash;there is no country in the world that has as limited
security threats as we do.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">21</font></sup>
But we <i>are</i> defending rich people, that&rsquo;s true&mdash;the
rich are defending themselves against the poor and the poor are
paying for it, so for that, it&rsquo;s true, you have to keep
increasing military spending. In fact, that&rsquo;s the main reason
we have the Pentagon system in the first place: it&rsquo;s a vehicle
to channel hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to the wealthy,
through military contracts and technology research and so on.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, the Pentagon&rsquo;s
never really been about defense: the Pentagon is about the fact that
rich people can have their own computers, after decades of
development paid for by the public through the state-sector&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s about the fact that I.B.M. and other private corporations
and investors are making huge profits off them. Or it&rsquo;s about
the fact that the biggest civilian exporter in the country is the
Boeing corporation, and the biggest single industry in the world,
tourism, is founded largely on technology that was developed through
the American military system&mdash;namely, airplanes&mdash;and that
it&rsquo;s been pouring huge sums of money into sectors of the
American economy for decades.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">22</font></sup>
Well, the Clinton administration and Congress have increased all of
those subsidies&mdash;in fact, Clinton&rsquo;s military budget is
well above the Cold War average&mdash;and the Contract With America
programs  include plenty of other forms of direct handouts and
subsidies to the wealthy as well.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">23</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The second kind of
welfare payment that&rsquo;s being extended is regressive fiscal
measures&mdash;which are just another way of disguising welfare to
the rich. So for example, if you increase tax deductions for business
expenses, let&rsquo;s say, that is the exact financial equivalent of
giving out a welfare check. I mean, suppose there&rsquo;s a mother
with six kids and no job, and she gets a hundred-dollar check&mdash;okay,
that&rsquo;s welfare. Now suppose it&rsquo;s me, somebody who&rsquo;s
rich, and I get a hundred dollars of tax relief because I have a home
mortgage: it&rsquo;s the same government payment. I mean, one of them
is a direct sum of money and the other is hidden in regressive fiscal
measures, but from an economic standpoint, they&rsquo;re exactly the
same thing&mdash;like, it would come out exactly the same if they
gave me the hundred dollars and took a hundred dollars off her taxes.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, if you take a
look at all of the welfare that goes to the rich through regressive
fiscal measures like these, it is absolutely huge. Take tax
write-offs for charitable contributions: almost all of that goes to
the rich, it&rsquo;s a way for them to cut down on their taxes&mdash;which
means it&rsquo;s a subsidy, exactly the equivalent of a welfare
check. Or take tax deductions for home mortgages: about 80 percent of
that welfare goes to people with incomes of over $50,000 a year, and
the deductions get disproportionately greater the higher your
income&mdash;like, if you have a million-dollar home, you get a much
bigger write-off than if you have a two hundred thousand-dollar home
or something.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">24</font></sup>
Or just look at income-tax deductions for business expenses: that is
a massive welfare program, and it all goes to the rich. So there&rsquo;s
a book by a Canadian writer, Linda McQuaig, which estimates that the
tax loss in Canada for what are called &ldquo;business entertainment
deductions&rdquo;&mdash;like taking your friends out to
hundred-dollar seats at the baseball game, and to fancy dinners and
all that kind of stuff&mdash;is not far below what would be needed to
give daycare to 750,000 Canadian kids who now can&rsquo;t get it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">25</font></sup>
And remember, Canada&rsquo;s a far smaller country than the United
States is, far smaller. Well, those are all welfare handouts too&mdash;and
what&rsquo;s happening is they&rsquo;re being increased, while at the
same time anything that might help poor people is being cut back.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s striking
to see the way they&rsquo;re doing it, actually. For instance, they
decided not to go after Medicare for now&mdash;they probably will
sooner or later, but for now they&rsquo;re not. And the reason is,
rich people get Medicare. But they <i>are</i> going after Medicaid
right away, because that only goes to poor people [Medicare is a
federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled, and
Medicaid is a federally-funded health care program for those with low
incomes]. In fact, there were three big programs that they intended
to go after right from the time of the &rsquo;94 election: one was
Medicaid, one was Aid for Families with Dependent Children, and the
third was Food Stamps. Well, Food Stamps quickly got kicked off the
list. You know why? Because there&rsquo;s a big agri-business lobby
behind it. See, Food Stamps does  happen to feed poor people, but
it&rsquo;s also a major handout to high-tech commercial agriculture
and big commerce, so those interests immediately started to lobby for
it&mdash;because they want it. So that was taken off the list.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">26</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What about Aid for
Families with Dependent Children? Well, for one thing, it&rsquo;s
dropped very sharply since 1970, even without &ldquo;Welfare Reform.&rdquo;
I mean, compared to 1970, maximum A.F.D.C. benefits for an average
family had fallen by about 40 percent in real terms by 1995.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">27</font></sup>
In fact, we always hear in the media and from politicians how there&rsquo;s
so much welfare for the poor in the United States, but the reality is
that the United States is completely off the international spectrum
in this respect&mdash;we give <i>far</i> less than any other
industrialized country.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">28</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, A.F.D.C. still
has around nine million young children on it; these guys want to take
five million of them off. Alright, those are <i>children</i>&mdash;average
age: seven.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">29</font></sup>
And if you just look at the families who are receiving welfare under
the program, what you find is that a substantial number of the
mothers are young women who&rsquo;ve been raped, or abused, or never
had any educational opportunities, and so on. Well, under the current
dogmas, their children, seven-year-old children, <i>they</i> have to
be taught &ldquo;fiscal responsibility&rdquo;&mdash;but not Newt
Gingrich&rsquo;s constituents. They have to keep being funded by the
public.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">30</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So Bill Clinton and
all these others are talking about &ldquo;welfare reform&rdquo; these
days&mdash;but no one&rsquo;s suggesting that we put <i>executives</i>
to work: they&rsquo;re going to keep getting welfare, it&rsquo;s only
poor mothers who are supposed to be forced into &ldquo;work
obligations&rdquo; [i.e. parents must obtain jobs or lose benefits
after receiving welfare for a specified period]. It&rsquo;s these
seven-year-old kids who now have to be forced to internalize our
values: that there are no human rights, they don&rsquo;t exist, the
only human rights people have are what they can gain for themselves
on the labor market. And the way they&rsquo;re going to be forced to
learn those lessons is by driving their mothers to work&mdash;instead
of all this non-work like raising children. I mean, it&rsquo;s
astonishing the sexism that has been so institutionalized in the
culture that people just accept the idea that raising children isn&rsquo;t
&ldquo;work&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;work&rdquo; is things like
speculating in financial markets. Child-care&rsquo;s just taken for
granted, it&rsquo;s supposed to come free because you don&rsquo;t get
a paycheck for it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8764_2032848809"></a>Crime
Control and &ldquo;Superfluous&rdquo; People<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The other thing the
Clinton &ldquo;New&rdquo; Democrats and Gingrich Republicans both
want is to build up crime control&mdash;and there&rsquo;s a very
simple reason for that: you&rsquo;ve got a big superfluous population
you aren&rsquo;t letting survive in your system, what are you going
to do with them? Answer: you lock them up. So in Reagan America, the
jail population in the U.S. more than tripled&mdash;<i>tripled</i>&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s been going up very fast ever since.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">31</font></sup>
In the  mid-1980s, the United States passed its main competitors in
per capita prison population: South Africa and Russia (though now
that Russia&rsquo;s learned our values, they&rsquo;ve caught up with
us again). So by this point, well over a million and a half people
are in prison in the United States&mdash;it&rsquo;s by far the
highest per capita prison population of the Western countries&mdash;and
it&rsquo;s going to go way up now, because the 1994 Crime Bill was
extremely harsh.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">32</font></sup>
Furthermore, the prisons in the United States are so <i>inhuman</i>
by this point that they are being condemned by international human
rights organizations as literally imposing torture.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">33</font></sup>
And these people all want to increase that&mdash;they&rsquo;re
statist reactionaries, remember: what they really want is a very
powerful and violent state, contrary to what they might say.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, if you just
look at the <i>composition</i> of the prison population, you&rsquo;ll
find that the crime-control policy that&rsquo;s been developed is
very finely honed to target select populations. So for example,
what&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;War on Drugs,&rdquo; which has very
little to do with stopping the flow of drugs, has a lot to do with
controlling the inner-city populations, and poor people in general.
In fact, by now over half the prisoners in federal prisons are there
on drug charges&mdash;and it&rsquo;s largely for possession offenses,
meaning victimless crimes, about a third just for marijuana.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">34</font></sup>
Moreover, the &ldquo;Drug War&rdquo; specifically has been targeted
on the black and Hispanic populations&mdash;that&rsquo;s one of its
most striking features. So for instance, the drug of choice in the
ghetto happens to be crack cocaine, and you get huge mandatory
sentences for it; the drug of choice in the white suburbs, like where
I live, happens to be powder cocaine, and you don&rsquo;t get
anywhere near the same penalties for it. In fact, the sentence ratio
for those drugs in the federal courts is 100 to 1.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">35</font></sup>
Okay?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And really there&rsquo;s
nothing particularly new about this kind of technique of population
control. So if you look at the history of marijuana prohibitions in
the United States, you&rsquo;ll find that they began with legislation
in the southwestern states which was aimed at Mexican immigrants who
were coming in, who happened to use marijuana. Now, nobody had any
reason to believe that marijuana was dangerous or anything like
that&mdash;and obviously it doesn&rsquo;t even come <i>close</i> to
alcohol, let alone tobacco, in its negative consequences. But these
laws were set up to try to control a population they were worried
about.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">36</font></sup> In
fact, if you look closely, even Prohibition had an element of this&mdash;it
was part of an effort to control groups like Irish immigrants and so
on. I mean, the Prohibition laws [which were part of the U.S.
Constitution from 1919 to 1933] were intended to close down the
saloons in New York City, not to stop the drinking in upper New York
State. In Westchester County and places like that, everybody just
continued on drinking exactly as before&mdash;but you didn&rsquo;t
want these immigrants to have saloons where they could get together
and become dangerous in the urban centers, and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">37</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, what&rsquo;s
been going on with drugs in recent years is kind of an analog of
that, but in the United States today it also happens to be
race-related,  for a number of reasons, so therefore it&rsquo;s in
large part aimed against black and Latino males. I mean, this is
mainly a war against the superfluous population, which is the poor
working class&mdash;but the race/class correlation is close enough in
the inner cities that when you go after the poor working class,
you&rsquo;re mostly going after blacks. So you get these astonishing
racial disparities in crime statistics, all across the board.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">38</font></sup>
And the point is, the urban poor are kind of a useless population
from the perspective of power, they don&rsquo;t really contribute to
profit-making, so as a result you want to get rid of them&mdash;and
the criminal justice system is one of the best ways of doing it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So take a
significant question you never hear asked despite this supposed &ldquo;Drug
War&rdquo; which has been going on for years and years: how many
bankers and chemical corporation executives are in prison in the
United States for drug-related offenses? Well, there was recently an
O.E.C.D. [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development]
study of the international drug racket, and they estimated that about
a half-trillion dollars of drug money gets laundered internationally
every year&mdash;more than half of it through American banks. I mean,
everybody talks about Colombia as the center of drug-money
laundering, but they&rsquo;re a small player: they have about $10
billion going through, U.S. banks have about <i>$260</i> billion.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">39</font></sup>
Okay, that&rsquo;s serious crime&mdash;it&rsquo;s not like robbing a
grocery store. So American bankers are laundering huge amounts of
drug money, everybody knows it: how many bankers are in jail? None.
But if a black kid gets caught with a joint, he goes to jail.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And actually, it
would be pretty easy to trace drug-money laundering if you were
serious about it&mdash;because the Federal Reserve requires that
banks give notification of all cash deposits made of over $10,000,
which means that if enough effort were put into monitoring them, you
could see where all the money&rsquo;s flowing. Well, the Republicans
deregulated in the 1980s&mdash;so now they don&rsquo;t check. In
fact, when George Bush was running the &ldquo;Drug War&rdquo; under
Reagan, he actually canceled the one federal program for this which
did exist, a project called &ldquo;Operation Greenback.&rdquo; It was
a pretty tiny thing anyway, and the whole Reagan/Bush program was
basically designed to let this go on&mdash;but as Reagan&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Drug Czar,&rdquo; Bush nevertheless canceled it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">40</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or why not ask
another question&mdash;how many U.S. chemical corporation executives
are in jail? Well, in the 1980s, the C.I.A. was asked to do a study
on chemical exports to Latin America, and what they estimated was
that more than 90 percent of them are not being used for industrial
production at all&mdash;and if you look at the kinds of chemicals
they are, it&rsquo;s obvious that what they&rsquo;re really being
used for is drug production.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">41</font></sup>
Okay, how many chemical corporation executives are in jail in the
United States? Again, none&mdash;because social policy is not
directed against the rich, it&rsquo;s directed against the poor.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, recently
there&rsquo;ve been some very interesting studies of urban police
behavior done at George Washington University, by a rather well-known
 criminologist named William Chambliss. For the last couple years
he&rsquo;s been running projects in cooperation with the Washington
D.C. police, in which he has law students and sociology students ride
with the police in their patrol cars to take transcripts of what
happens. I mean, you&rsquo;ve got to read this stuff: it is all
targeted against the black and Hispanic populations, almost entirely.
And they are not treated like a <i>criminal</i> population, because
criminals have Constitutional rights&mdash;they&rsquo;re treated like
a population under military occupation. So the <i>effective</i> laws
are, the police go to somebody&rsquo;s house, they smash in the door,
they beat the people up, they grab some kid they want, and they throw
him in jail. And the police aren&rsquo;t doing it because they&rsquo;re
all bad people, you know&mdash;that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re being
told to do.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">42</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, part of the
Contract With America was to increase all of this. They weren&rsquo;t
satisfied with the 1994 Crime Bill&mdash;and the reason is, the
original 1994 Crime Bill still allowed for things like Pell Grants
for people in prison [i.e. college subsidies available to capable,
low-income students], which are a very small expense. See, most of
the people who are in jail have never completed high school, and Pell
Grants help give them some degree of education. Alright, there are
many studies of this, and it&rsquo;s turned out that the effect of
Pell Grants is to cut back on recidivism, to cut back violence. But
for people like the Gingrich Republicans, that doesn&rsquo;t make any
sense&mdash;they <i>want</i> people in jail, and they want violence,
so they&rsquo;re going to cut out small expenses like that so that we
can have even more people thrown into jail.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">43</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Also, all of this
&ldquo;crime control&rdquo; spending is another huge taxpayer
stimulus to the economy&mdash;mainly to parts of the construction
industry, and to lawyers, and other professionals. Well, that&rsquo;s
another very useful way to force the public to keep paying off the
rich&mdash;and by now &ldquo;crime control&rdquo; spending is
approaching the Pentagon budget in scale; it&rsquo;s still not quite
as favored as the Pentagon, because the spending&rsquo;s not as
sharply skewed towards the wealthy, but nevertheless it&rsquo;s
useful.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">44</font></sup> And
as the society keeps taking on more and more Third World-type
characteristics, we should certainly expect that the repression will
continue&mdash;and that it will continue to be funded and extended,
through the Contract With America or whatever other technique they
can come up with.</p>

and Repression<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Dr. Chomsky,
around where I work out in Fresno, California, the local government
has instituted a policy where they have three S.W.A.T. teams roving
the streets with rifles, to reduce the level of violence. My question
for you is, as an organizer, how can one deal with the fact that this
is what the people really want?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What is what the
people really want? They want S.W.A.T. teams?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Yeah.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Who wants them&mdash;the
people in the slums?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Well, the
mayor ran his election campaign on this; it&rsquo;s a pilot project
in California.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">45</font></sup></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And who voted for
him&mdash;the people in the slums?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I don&rsquo;t
really know . . .</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there are a
couple of points to be made. First of all, I don&rsquo;t know Fresno
specifically, but the way it usually works is, voting in the United
States is a very skewed affair: the wealthy have a huge amount of
clout, largely because of business propaganda, but also through a
whole range of other methods, including things like gerrymandering.
So that&rsquo;s one point.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But another thing
is, this whole bit about &ldquo;combating violence&rdquo; is
something you&rsquo;ve really got to look at more closely. So I don&rsquo;t
know the particular area you&rsquo;re talking about very well, but
the fact is, a large portion of the country&rsquo;s population is
being dismissed as superfluous because they do not play a role in
profit-making&mdash;and those people are increasingly being cooped up
in concentration camps, which we happen to call &ldquo;slums.&rdquo;
Now, it&rsquo;s true that internal to those concentration camps
there&rsquo;s a lot of violence&mdash;but that&rsquo;s kind of like
violence internal to a family or something: wealthier sectors are
pretty well insulated from it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">46</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So take me: I live
in a mostly lily-white, very liberal professional suburb just outside
Boston, called Lexington. And we have our own police force, which is
mostly for finding stray cats and things like that. Except for one
thing: it&rsquo;s also a Border Patrol. I mean, nobody there will
tell you this, but if you want to find it out, just get some black
friend of yours to drive a broken-down car into Lexington and watch
how many seconds it takes before he&rsquo;s out.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
how the panic about combating violence tends to play out. But if you
actually look at the <i>facts</i> about the general level of violence
in the U.S., there&rsquo;s really no evidence that it&rsquo;s
increased over the past twenty years&mdash;in fact, the statistics
say it&rsquo;s actually decreased.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">47</font></sup>
Furthermore, contrary to what a lot of people believe, crime rates in
the United States are not all that high relative to other
countries&mdash;if you look at other developed countries, like
Australia and France and so on, U.S. crime rates are sort of at the
high end, but not off the spectrum. In fact, about the only category
in which U.S. crime rates are way off the map is homicides with
guns&mdash;but that&rsquo;s because of crazy gun-control laws here,
it doesn&rsquo;t particularly have to do with &ldquo;crime.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">48</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, the popular
<i>perception</i> certainly is that violence is greater today&mdash;but
that&rsquo;s mostly propaganda: that&rsquo;s just a part of the whole
effort to make  people frightened, so that they&rsquo;ll abandon
their rights. And of course, it all has a real racist undertone to
it, there are little code words that are used, &ldquo;Willie Horton&rdquo;
kinds of things, to try to get everyone to think there&rsquo;s some
black man out there trying to rape their daughter. [Horton was a
black prisoner who raped a white woman while on furlough from prison;
his image was used by the Republicans in T.V. ads to portray the
Democrats as &ldquo;soft on crime.&rdquo;] Yeah, that&rsquo;s the
kind of image you want to convey if your goal is to keep people
divided and calling for more repression in the society. And the
success of it all in the last few years has been very dramatic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, the
perception of more violence is rather like what&rsquo;s happened in
the case of welfare: people&rsquo;s <i>image</i> is that welfare has
gone way up, but the reality is, it&rsquo;s gone way, way down.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">49</font></sup>
So I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;ve looked at the polls on this,
but people&rsquo;s attitudes are really quite striking. For example,
when you ask them, &ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;re spending too much
on welfare or too little?,&rdquo; 44 percent say we&rsquo;re spending
too much, and 23 percent say we&rsquo;re spending too little. But if
you take exactly the same question and you just replace the word
&ldquo;welfare&rdquo; with &ldquo;assistance to the poor&rdquo;&mdash;so
now you&rsquo;re saying, &ldquo;Are we giving too much or too little
assistance to the poor?&rdquo;&mdash;the numbers change radically: 13
percent say it&rsquo;s too much, and 64 percent say it&rsquo;s too
little.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">50</font></sup>
Alright, that&rsquo;s kind of funny: what&rsquo;s welfare? It&rsquo;s
assistance to the poor. So how come you get this strange result?
Because people have bought the racist line. The image they have of
&ldquo;welfare&rdquo; is black mothers driving Cadillacs past some
poor white guy who&rsquo;s working: Reaganite propaganda. And I think
it&rsquo;s pretty much the same kind of story with the perception of
more violence.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look: the public
relations industry doesn&rsquo;t spend billions of dollars just for
the fun of it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">51</font></sup>
They do it for reasons, and those reasons are to instill certain
imagery, and to impose certain means of social control. And one of
the best means of controlling people has always been induced fear:
for Hitler it was Jews and homosexuals and Gypsies; here it&rsquo;s
blacks.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So yes, there <i>is</i>
violence&mdash;but it&rsquo;s mostly the kind of violence that
results from being cooped up in concentration camps. I mean, if you
look at Hitler&rsquo;s concentration camps during World War II, there
was also internal violence. That happens: if people are sufficiently
deprived, they&rsquo;ll turn on one another. But when you say that
people in California want S.W.A.T. teams, I doubt that the people in
the concentration camps do&mdash;because those S.W.A.T. teams are at
war with them. It&rsquo;s just that those people typically are not a
part of the &ldquo;public&rdquo; that actually decides on things in
the United States; more powerful elements do. And they decide the way
they do for the same reason the liberals out in Lexington want a
Border Patrol, although they won&rsquo;t say so of course: because
you want to confine the violence somewhere else, so your own family
won&rsquo;t be affected.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Like, take Cobb
County, Georgia, the rich suburb outside Atlanta that&rsquo;s Newt
Gingrich&rsquo;s district&mdash;which gets more federal subsidies
than any suburban county in the United States, incidentally, despite
its leader&rsquo;s calls to &ldquo;get government off our backs&rdquo;
(only Arlington, Virginia, the home of the  Pentagon, and Brevard
County, Florida, where the Kennedy Space Center is, get more). Well,
in Cobb County, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re also very afraid of
violence and want S.W.A.T. teams to insulate them from any urban
infection that might make its way out from downtown Atlanta.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">52</font></sup>
Sure, and it&rsquo;s the same thing all over the place. So I suspect
that&rsquo;s probably what you&rsquo;re seeing in Fresno as well.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, if you <i>really</i>
want to talk about violence, there&rsquo;s plenty of it&mdash;but not
the kind you&rsquo;re talking about. For example, take the biggest
killer of them all: tobacco. Compared with tobacco, hard drugs don&rsquo;t
even <i>exist.</i> Deaths from tobacco <i>far</i> outweigh deaths
from all hard drugs combined, probably by a factor of more than a
hundred.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">53</font></sup> Do
you see Jesse Helms in jail? I mean, there used to be a House
Committee that regulated among other things the tobacco industry&mdash;it&rsquo;s
gone now, because it was flat taken over by a tobacco company&mdash;but
in its last meeting, its members released a study that made it to the
back pages of the newspapers, and was very interesting. It turned out
that the data that everybody had been using for the last couple years
on the effects of passive smoking [i.e. breathing of smoke from other
people&rsquo;s cigarettes] were coming from tobacco-industry
studies&mdash;and they were faked. People re-did the studies and
found that they were a total fraud, they made the problem look far
less significant.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">54</font></sup>
Alright, that means these tobacco-industry executives and their U.S.
government puppets have been killing thousands and thousands of
people&mdash;they&rsquo;re killing young children, say, whose mothers
are smoking. Are they in jail? Why isn&rsquo;t that violence?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, right now
U.S. state power is being used to force Asian countries to open their
markets to advertising for American tobacco. For instance, we&rsquo;re
telling China, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t allow us to advertise tobacco
to the emerging markets of women and youth, and we&rsquo;ll close off
your exports&rdquo;&mdash;so then they just have to do it. Alright,
recently there was a study done at Oxford University which estimated
that of the kids under 20 alive today in China, about fifty million
of them are going to die from tobacco-related diseases. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">56</font></sup>
Killing fifty million people is fairly impressive, even by
twentieth-century standards&mdash;why isn&rsquo;t that &ldquo;violence&rdquo;?
That&rsquo;s the violence of the American state working for the
interests of American tobacco manufacturers. You wouldn&rsquo;t need
S.W.A.T. teams to go after that kind of violence, you&rsquo;d just
need to apply laws. The trouble is, it&rsquo;s the rich and the
powerful who enforce the laws, and they don&rsquo;t want to apply
them to themselves.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam, you
just mentioned that Gingrich&rsquo;s county in Georgia is one of the
leading recipients of federal government subsidies&mdash;I was
wondering, why didn&rsquo;t the Democrats make that an issue during
the 1994 elections? I&rsquo;ve never heard it before, but you&rsquo;d
have thought that would be a very strong tactic for them to use at
the time, given the Gingrich group&rsquo;s campaign strategy?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">That&rsquo;s an
interesting side-light to the &rsquo;94 election story, isn&rsquo;t
it&mdash;the absolute silence of the Democrats about that? I mean,
during the whole campaign, Newt Gingrich was just slaughtering them
with the line that they&rsquo;re always pushing the &ldquo;welfare
state&rdquo; and the &ldquo;nanny state&rdquo; and all this
government spending all the time&mdash;but no one in the press or in
the political system ever once made the obvious rejoinder that would
have wiped him out in three minutes: that <i>Newt Gingrich</i> is the
leading advocate of the welfare state in the entire country. I mean,
that would have been the end of the entire discussion&mdash;but the
Democrats never even raised a peep. Like, nobody raised the fact that
the largest employer in Cobb County is the Lockheed corporation [an
armaments contractor], a publicly-subsidized/ private-profit
corporation that wouldn&rsquo;t <i>exist</i> except for taxpayer
subsidies. Or nobody pointed out that 72 percent of the jobs in Cobb
County are white-collar jobs in industries like electronics and
computers&mdash;which are all very carefully tended by the &ldquo;nanny
state,&rdquo; and in fact wouldn&rsquo;t be around in the first place
if it hadn&rsquo;t been for massive public subsidies through the
military system for decades.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">56</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And I think the
reason for that lack of comment is pretty obvious, actually. I think
the reason is that class interests overpower narrow political
interests, and there&rsquo;s a real and very important class
interest, shared right across the board in the United States, that
the rich always must be protected from market discipline by a very
powerful welfare state&mdash;that simply can&rsquo;t be called into
question at all. I mean, the <i>poor</i> can be subjected to the
market&mdash;that&rsquo;s perfectly fine. But not the rich: they need
constant subsidies and protection, like they get in Cobb County.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, you can&rsquo;t
say any of that <i>publicly</i>, of course, because then people might
start to get the idea&mdash;and that would be very dangerous. So
therefore, even if they get smashed in the elections, the Democrats
still won&rsquo;t tell you the truth: that Newt Gingrich is the
leading advocate of the &ldquo;nanny state,&rdquo; and that what he
wants is a big, powerful, interventionist government that will keep
providing the rich with constant economic subsidy and protection. The
1994 elections were a perfect illustration of the point&mdash;and
again, it&rsquo;s another sign of the kind of democracy we really
have in the United States that nobody even mentioned it.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8768_2032848809"></a>International
Capital: the New Imperial Age<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: In the past
twenty-five years, there has been such a massive expansion of
multinational finance capital being used for speculation in
international stock markets, rather than for investment and trade,
that it seems by now the United States is just a colony at the mercy
of the movements of international capital&mdash;it doesn&rsquo;t much
matter who&rsquo;s in office, they&rsquo;re not the ones really
setting the agenda anymore. What&rsquo;s the significance of that
phenomenon on the international scene right now?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, first of all,
we really ought to be a bit more cautious with our language&mdash;including
myself, because I talk this way all the time. We shouldn&rsquo;t talk
about things like &ldquo;the United States&rdquo;&mdash;because there
is no such entity, just like there&rsquo;s no such entity as
&ldquo;England&rdquo; or &ldquo;Japan&rdquo; or anything like that.
The <i>population</i> of the United States may be &ldquo;colonized,&rdquo;
but the <i>corporate interests</i> that are based in the United
States aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;colonized&rdquo; at all. So you sometimes
hear about &ldquo;America in decline&rdquo;&mdash;and if you look at
the share of the world&rsquo;s manufacturing production that happens
to <i>take place</i> in the United States, it&rsquo;s true, that is
in decline. But if you look at the share of the world&rsquo;s
manufacturing production that&rsquo;s done by <i>U.S.-based
corporations</i> , that&rsquo;s not in decline at all: in fact, it&rsquo;s
doing extremely nicely. It&rsquo;s just that that production is now
taking place mostly in the Third World.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">57</font></sup>
So you know, one can talk about the geographical entity &ldquo;the
United States&rdquo;&mdash;but that is not what functions in world
affairs. To be brief about it, unless you begin with an elementary
class analysis, you aren&rsquo;t even in the real world: things like
&ldquo;the United States&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t entities.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But you&rsquo;re
right, most of the <i>population</i> of the United States is being
driven towards kind of a Third World &ldquo;colonized&rdquo;
status&mdash;it&rsquo;s just that we should remember, there&rsquo;s
another sector in the world, which includes rich corporate executives
and investors, plus their people in the Third World, like some Mafia
thug in Russia who&rsquo;s running their local thing for them or some
rich guy in S&atilde;o Paulo, and they&rsquo;re a much different
grouping. Those people have never been doing better.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, about
speculative capital&mdash;that&rsquo;s an extremely important part of
this. You&rsquo;re absolutely correct that it&rsquo;s having a huge
impact on national governments. This is really a major phenomenon.
Just the numbers themselves are dramatic.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Back around 1970,
about 90 percent of the capital involved in international economic
transactions was being used for more or less productive commercial
purposes, like production and trade, and about 10 percent was being
used for speculation. Today those figures are reversed: by 1990,
about 90 percent was being used for speculation, and by 1994 it was
up to <i>95</i> percent. Furthermore, the absolute <i>amount</i> of
speculative capital has just exploded: the last estimate I saw from
the World Bank was that there is now about $14 trillion
involved&mdash;which means there&rsquo;s now $14 trillion free to
transfer from one national economy to another, an amount which just
overwhelms any national government&rsquo;s resources, and leaves
governments with only an extremely narrow range of choices when it
comes to setting policies.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">58</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, why has this
huge growth of speculative capital happened? There have been two key
reasons. The first had to do with the breakdown of the post-war world
economic system, which occurred in the early 1970s. See, during the
Second World War, the United States basically reorganized the world
economic system and made itself into sort of the &ldquo;global
banker&rdquo; [at the Bretton Woods United Nations Monetary and
Financial Conference of  1944]&mdash;so, the U.S. dollar became the
global reserve currency, it was fixed to gold, and other countries&rsquo;
currencies were fixed relative to the dollar. And that system was
pretty much what lay behind the very substantial economic growth rate
that followed in the 1950s and Sixties. But by the 1970s, the
&ldquo;Bretton Woods&rdquo; system had become unsustainable: the U.S.
no longer was strong enough economically to remain the world&rsquo;s
banker, primarily because of the huge costs of financing the Vietnam
War. So Richard Nixon at that point made a decision to just dismantle
the whole arrangement: in the early 1970s he took the United States
off the gold standard, he raised import duties, he just destroyed the
whole system totally. Well, after this international regulatory
apparatus had been destroyed, we started to get speculation against
currencies on an unprecedented scale, and fluctuating financial
exchanges, all these other things that have kept growing ever since.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The second main
factor behind this explosion of speculative capital has been the
technological revolution in telecommunications&mdash;which took place
in the same period, and which suddenly made it very easy to transfer
currencies from one country to another. So for example, today
virtually the whole of the New York Stock Exchange moves overnight to
Tokyo: the money is in New York in the daytime, then they just wire
it over to Japan every night, and since Japan is 14 hours ahead of
us, the same money is used in both places. And by now, about a
trillion dollars a day moves around in international speculative
markets like that&mdash;and that has just a huge effect on national
governments.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">59</font></sup>
In fact, by this point, what it means is that the international
investing community has virtual veto-power over what any national
government can do.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">We&rsquo;re seeing
it in the United States right now, actually. The United States has
had a very sluggish recovery from the last recession&mdash;it may be
the slowest recovery ever; certainly it&rsquo;s the slowest one since
the end of the Second World War. But it&rsquo;s been sluggish in only
one respect: there&rsquo;s been very low economic growth, very little
job creation (in fact, for many years wages were actually going <i>down</i>
in this &ldquo;recovery&rdquo;), but profits have been absolutely
zooming.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">60</font></sup> So
every year <i>Fortune</i> magazine has an issue devoted to the
well-being of the important people of the world, the <i>&ldquo;Fortune</i>
500,&rdquo; and what it&rsquo;s reported during this period is that
profits went through the sky: in 1993 they were very happy, in 1994
they were euphoric, and 1995 just broke all records. Meanwhile real
wages were going down, growth was very low, production was low&mdash;and
even the slow growth that&rsquo;s been taking place has been halted
at times because the bond market, as they put it, &ldquo;signaled&rdquo;
that it didn&rsquo;t like the growth.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, financial
speculators don&rsquo;t want growth: what they want is stable
currencies, meaning <i>no</i> growth. In fact, the business press
talks very openly now about &ldquo;the threat of too much growth,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the threat of too much employment&rdquo;: they&rsquo;re
perfectly open about all of this, to one another.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">61</font></sup>
And the reason for it is, people who speculate against currencies are
afraid of inflation&mdash;because  it decreases the value of their
money, so therefore it&rsquo;s a big threat to them. And any kind of
growth, any kind of stimulation of the economy, any decline of
unemployment all threaten to increase inflation. Well, currency
speculators don&rsquo;t like that, so if they see signs of
stimulative economic policies or anything that may bring economic
growth, they&rsquo;ll just take their capital out of that country&rsquo;s
economy&mdash;and even a slight withdrawal of that sort can easily
trigger a recession in those countries.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So what&rsquo;s
happened as a result of all of this is a big drift internationally
towards low-growth, low-wage, high-profit economies&mdash;because
national governments trying to make economic and social policy
decisions just have very little leeway to do so by now, or else their
economies will be wrecked by capital flight. I mean, Third World
governments have no chance at all of doing so at this point&mdash;they
don&rsquo;t even have any possibility of carrying out a national
economic policy. But by now, it&rsquo;s even a question whether big
countries can&mdash;including the United States. I mean, I don&rsquo;t
think that any administration we&rsquo;ve had in the United States
has <i>wanted</i> to do things much differently here&mdash;but if
they <i>had</i> wanted to, I think it would have been extremely hard,
if not impossible.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Just to give you an
indication, right after the 1992 election, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
ran a front-page article just informing its readers that there was no
reason to fear that any of the alleged &ldquo;lefties&rdquo; around
Clinton would do things differently when they got into office. Of
course, the business community already knew that perfectly well, as
you can see by taking a look at the stock markets towards the end of
the election campaign. But in any event, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
explained why, if by some accident Clinton or any other candidate <i>did</i>
try to initiate a program of social reform in the United States, it
would immediately be cut off. They simply stated what&rsquo;s
obvious, and they gave the numbers.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The United States is
deeply in debt&mdash;that was part of the whole Reagan /Bush program,
in fact: to put the country so deeply in debt that there would be
virtually no way for the government to pursue programs of social
spending anymore. And what &ldquo;being in debt&rdquo; really means
is that the Treasury Department has sold a ton of securities&mdash;bonds
and notes and so on&mdash;to investors, who then trade them back and
forth on the bond market. Well, according to the <i>Wall Street
Journal</i>, by now about $150 billion a day worth of U.S. Treasury
securities alone is traded this way. The article then explained what
this means: it means that if the investing community which holds
those securities doesn&rsquo;t like any U.S. government policies, it
can very quickly sell off just a tiny signal amount of Treasury
bonds, and that will have the automatic effect of raising the
interest rate, which then will have the further automatic effect of
increasing the deficit. Okay, this article calculated that if such a
&ldquo;signal&rdquo; sufficed to raise the interest rate by 1
percent, it would add $20 billion to the deficit overnight&mdash;meaning
if Clinton (say in someone&rsquo;s dream) proposed a $20 billion
social spending program, the international investing community could
effectively turn it into a <i>$40</i> billion  program instantly,
just by a signal, and any further moves in that direction would be
totally cut off.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">62</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Similarly, there was
a great article in the London <i>Economist</i>&mdash;you know, the
big free-trade pop-ideology journal&mdash;about the fact that Eastern
European countries have been voting Socialists and Communists back
into power. But the basic line of the article was, don&rsquo;t worry
about it, because as they said, &ldquo;policy is insulated from
politics&rdquo;&mdash;meaning, no matter what games these guys play
in the political arena, policy&rsquo;s going to go on exactly the way
it is, because we&rsquo;ve got them by the balls: we control the
international currencies, we&rsquo;re the only ones who can give them
loans, we can destroy their economies if we want to, there&rsquo;s
nothing they can do. I mean, they can play all of the political games
they want to, they can pretend they have a democracy if they
like&mdash;anything they please&mdash;so long as &ldquo;policy
remains insulated from politics.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">63</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What&rsquo;s been
happening in the contemporary period is really something quite new in
history, actually. I mean, in recent years a completely new form of
government is being pioneered, one designed to serve the developing
needs of this new international corporate ruling class&mdash;it&rsquo;s
what has sometimes been called an emerging &ldquo;de facto world
government.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what all of the new international
trade agreements are about, N.A.F.T.A., G.A.T.T., and so on; it&rsquo;s
what the E.E.C. [European Economic Community] is about; it&rsquo;s
increasingly taking shape in international financial organizations
like the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the
Inter-American Development Bank, the World Trade Organization, the
G-7 planning meetings of the rich industrial countries, and so on and
so forth. These are all efforts to try to centralize power in a world
economic system geared towards ensuring that &ldquo;policy is
insulated from politics&rdquo;&mdash;in other words, towards ensuring
that the general populations of the world have no role in
decision-making, and that the level of policy planning is raised to
be so remote from people&rsquo;s knowledge and understanding and
input that they have absolutely no idea about the various decisions
that are being made that will affect their lives, and certainly
couldn&rsquo;t influence them if they did.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">The World Bank has
its own term for the phenomenon: they call it &ldquo;technocratic
insulation.&rdquo; So if you read World Bank studies, they talk about
the importance of having &ldquo;technocratic insulation&rdquo;&mdash;meaning
a bunch of technocrats, who are essentially employees of the big
transnational corporations, have to be working somewhere in
&ldquo;insulation&rdquo; from the public to design all the policies,
because if the public ever gets involved in the process they may have
bad ideas, like wanting the kind of economic growth that does things
for people instead of profits, all sorts of stupid stuff like that.
So therefore what you want to have is insulated technocrats&mdash;and
once they&rsquo;re insulated enough, then you can have all the
&ldquo;democracy&rdquo; you like, since it&rsquo;s not going to make
any difference. In the international business press, this has all
been described pretty frankly as &ldquo;The New Imperial Age.&rdquo;
And that&rsquo;s quite accurate: it&rsquo;s certainly the direction
things are going in.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">64</font></sup></p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8770_2032848809"></a>The
Fairy Tale Economy<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: A few
moments ago, you described the 1990s economy as &ldquo;sluggish,&rdquo;
with low growth and low wages. Usually we hear that this is a &ldquo;fairy
tale&rdquo; economy and everything&rsquo;s wonderful. Can you say
something more about that?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, there&rsquo;s
a very important book that comes out every two years, called <i>The
State of Working America.</i> It&rsquo;s kind of the main, standard
database for what&rsquo;s going on for working people&mdash;meaning
most everybody in the economy. The latest data goes up through 1997.
And it tells you just what the &ldquo;fairy tale&rdquo; economy is.
It&rsquo;s nothing that everybody doesn&rsquo;t know, they just give
all the data.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Since the
mid-Seventies, the economy has slowed down: there&rsquo;s been a
period of much lower growth than the post-war period. Virtually all
the wealth that&rsquo;s been created has gone to the very top part of
the income distribution. The typical family is now working about
fifteen weeks a year more than they did twenty years ago, at
stagnating or declining real incomes. The United States now has the
heaviest workload in the industrial world. It&rsquo;s also the only
country in the industrial world that doesn&rsquo;t have legally
mandated vacations. And with that, incomes are at best stagnating for
the majority of the population.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">65</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, it <i>is</i> a
&ldquo;fairy tale&rdquo; economy&mdash;and the reason it&rsquo;s a
&ldquo;fairy tale&rdquo; economy is because for the top few percent
of the population, incomes have gone through the roof. The book
points out that essentially the only gains in the past twenty years
have been to C.E.O.s, and through asset inflation in the stock
market. Well, you take a look at assets on the stock market, they
also give figures for that: it turns out that roughly half are owned
by the top one percent of the population&mdash;and of that, most is
owned by the top one-half percent. So one percent owns roughly half
the stock; the top ten percent own most of the rest. About 85 percent
of the total increase in stock values in this great stock-boom have
gone to the top ten percent of the population, mostly to the top
one-half percent.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">66</font></sup>
In fact, the second decile&mdash;you know, the 90th to 80th
percentiles in income levels&mdash;have actually lost net worth
during the Clinton recovery (net worth meaning assets minus debt).
Below that, it&rsquo;s mostly worse.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">67</font></sup>
The ones who have been hit hardest are the youngest. So entry-level
wages are about 20 to 30 percent lower than they were twenty years
ago, which tells you what&rsquo;s going to happen up the road. It&rsquo;s
now even true for white-collar workers, even scientists and
engineers. Unless they&rsquo;re in a very high bracket, their wages
and incomes are declining.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">68</font></sup>
So that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;fairy tale&rdquo; economy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">This Clinton
recovery&mdash;which one kind of wonders about&mdash;is the first one
certainly in post-war history, maybe in American history, in which
most of the population has been left out. I mean, it wasn&rsquo;t
until the end of 1997 that median real income reached the level of
1989, which was the  peak of the last business cycle.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">69</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s unheard of: in every other recovery, median income has
been way higher this many years after the peak of the last business
cycle.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But for some
sectors, it&rsquo;s fantastic. And part of the reason is just
intimidating working people with job insecurity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So this is a very
good book&mdash;it&rsquo;s put out by the Economic Policy Institute.

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8772_2032848809"></a>Building
International Unions<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: Noam,
facing an international power structure like the one you describe,
which seems to be showing no signs of letting up as it extends its
grip, clearly the response has to be organized and coordinated on a
mass scale internationally. But given the size of the problems and
just the scale of the task we&rsquo;re faced with, it seems nearly
impossible to me, frankly. Even just building the kinds of unions we
need to develop in the United States seems like a daunting prospect.
Do you think it&rsquo;s really possible in today&rsquo;s world?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Reconstructing a
democratic trade-union movement in the United States? Sure, I don&rsquo;t
see why that&rsquo;s an impossible task, it&rsquo;s certainly
something that&rsquo;s been done before. But you&rsquo;re right that
it&rsquo;s not going to be so simple.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For one thing, in
the contemporary period something that&rsquo;s surely going to be
required, which does make it a lot harder than before, is that a real
labor movement simply <i>has</i> to be international today. I mean,
in the old days, labor activists used to talk about &ldquo;Internationals,&rdquo;
but that was mostly a joke. Now the labor movement just <i>has</i> to
be international&mdash;because there has to be something to prevent
Daimler-Benz, for example, from destroying German work standards by
shifting production over to Alabama, where wages are much lower, and
the labor&rsquo;s not unionized, and legislative protections for
workers are much weaker. Or take the original Free Trade Agreement
with Canada [implemented in 1989]: in the first few years of that,
Canada lost a couple hundred thousand manufacturing jobs to the
Southeastern United States for the same reasons.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">71</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, it&rsquo;s
gotten to the point where some major corporations don&rsquo;t even
worry about strikes anymore, they see them as an opportunity to
destroy unions. For instance, the Caterpillar corporation recently
broke an eighteen-month strike in Decatur, Illinois [from June 1994
to December 1995], and part of the way they did it was by developing
excess production  capacity in foreign countries. See, major
corporations have a ton of capital now, and one of the things they&rsquo;ve
been able to do with it is to build up extra overseas production
capacity. So Caterpillar has been building plants in Brazil&mdash;where
they get far cheaper labor than in the United States&mdash;and then
they can use that production capability to fill their international
orders in the event of a strike in the U.S. So they didn&rsquo;t
really mind the strike in Decatur, because it gave them an
opportunity to finally break the union through this international
strategy.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">72</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;s relatively new, and given this
increasing centralization of power in the international economy, and
the ability of big transnational corporations to play one national
workforce against another to drive down work standards everywhere,
there just has to be international solidarity today if there&rsquo;s
going to be any hope&mdash;and that means <i>real</i> international
solidarity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Another thing that
has to happen for an international trade union movement to really be
successful, in my opinion, is that it is simply going to have to be
started from the ground up and be run by its participants. And that
kind of serious organizing is something that is very difficult to do.
It&rsquo;s going to be particularly tricky in the United
States&mdash;because the labor leadership here has traditionally been
almost completely divorced from the workforce. So take a look at the
world-wide destruction of unions after the Second World War: that&rsquo;s
had a really major impact on working conditions throughout the world,
and some of the people who were doing it were in fact the American
labor leadership at the time&mdash;they were a big part of the whole
effort to break up the Italian unions, and the Japanese unions, and
the French unions, and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">73</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you look back to
the history of the reconstruction of post-World War II Europe,
American planners were very intent on preventing the rise of
popular-democratic movements there which would have been based in the
former anti-fascist resistance, which had a lot of prestige right
then. And the reason was, the world in general was very
social-democratic after the war, especially as a result of the
anti-fascist struggles that had taken place. And with the traditional
order discredited and a whole lot of radical-democratic ideas around,
powerful interests in the United States were extremely concerned that
a unified labor movement could develop in a place like Germany or
Japan.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, the same
kind of problem also existed at home right then as well: the U.S.
population was very social-democratic after the war&mdash;it was
extremely pro-union, it wanted more government involvement in
regulating industry, probably a majority thought there should even be
<i>public</i> industry&mdash;and business was terrified by it, they
were very scared. They in fact said in their publications things
like, &ldquo;We have about five or six years to save the private
enterprise system.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">74</font></sup>
Well, one thing they did was to launch a huge propaganda program in
the United States, aimed at reversing these attitudes. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">75</font></sup>
It was actually called at the time part of &ldquo;the everlasting
battle for the minds of men,&rdquo; who have to be &ldquo;indoctrinated
in the capitalist story&rdquo;;  that&rsquo;s a standard straight
quote from the P.R. literature.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">76</font></sup>
So in the early 1950s, the Advertising Council [an organization begun
during World War II and funded by the business community to assist
the government with propaganda services at home] was spending huge
amounts of money to propagandize for what they called &ldquo;the
American way.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">77</font></sup>
The public relations budget for the National Association of
Manufacturers I think went up by about a factor of twenty.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">78</font></sup>
About a third of the textbooks in schools were simply provided by
business.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">79</font></sup>
They had 20 million people a week watching propaganda films about
worker-management unity, after the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947 allowed
propaganda to be shown to basically captive audiences in companies.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">80</font></sup>
They continued on with the &ldquo;scientific methods of
strikebreaking&rdquo; that had been developed in the late 1930s:
devoting huge resources into propaganda instead of goon-squads and
breaking knees.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">81</font></sup>
And it was all tied up with the &ldquo;anti-Communist&rdquo; crusade
at the time&mdash;that&rsquo;s the true meaning of what&rsquo;s
referred to as &ldquo;McCarthyism,&rdquo; which started well before
Joseph McCarthy got involved and was really launched by business and
liberal members of the Democratic Party and so on.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">82</font></sup>
It was a way of using fear and jingoism to try to undermine labor
rights and functioning democracy.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And the point is,
the leadership of the U.S. labor movement was right in the center of
the whole post-war destruction of unions, internationally. In fact,
if you look back at their records, which are very fascinating, one of
the things that they were most afraid of when they helped to smash
the Italian unions, for example, was that they were just too
democratic&mdash;they wanted them to be more like American unions,
and they said so. &ldquo;American unions&rdquo; means the A.F.L.
leadership sits in a room somewhere and none of the workforce knows
what&rsquo;s going on, the leaders make the decisions, then they go
out and have lunch with some guy in the government or a
corporation&mdash;that&rsquo;s the way a union&rsquo;s supposed to
work here. The trouble is, the Italian unions weren&rsquo;t like
that. I might be exaggerating it a little&mdash;but if you look back
at these guys&rsquo; records, they say it in roughly those words,
actually. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">83</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, when you have
a history of labor leadership like that, it&rsquo;s another reason
why reconstituting a union movement here is simply going to have to
start from the bottom up&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s
an impossible job. It&rsquo;s certainly been done under much harsher
conditions than we face. I mean, if it&rsquo;s possible in El
Salvador to organize a union when you&rsquo;ve got death squads
running after you and murdering you, and then we ask, &ldquo;Is this
too hard for us?&rdquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s kind of like a joke. If it&rsquo;s
not happening, it&rsquo;s because people aren&rsquo;t doing it: it&rsquo;s
not because it&rsquo;s too hard, it&rsquo;s because people aren&rsquo;t
doing it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So take Haiti, the
most impoverished country in the Hemisphere. I don&rsquo;t know if
any of you have ever traveled to Haiti, but if you go there, you can
barely believe it&mdash;I&rsquo;ve gone to a lot of parts of the
Third World, and Haiti is just something else. But in Haiti in the
late 1980s, under extremely repressive  and impoverished conditions,
Haitian peasants and slum-dwellers were able to create an organized
civil society: they succeeded in creating unions, and grassroots
organizations, and a whole network of popular groupings which
achieved such strength that, with no resources at all, they were able
to take over the government. Now, it turns out they immediately got
smashed by a military coup which we were assisting&mdash;but that
shows you what people can do in the world.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">84</font></sup>
If you read the American press when the coup collapsed [in 1994],
they were all saying, &ldquo;Now we have to go down and teach lessons
in democracy to the Haitians&rdquo;&mdash;but anybody except a
complete commissar ought to have burst out in ridicule at that. We
have to <i>learn</i> about democracy from the Haitians, Haitian
peasants have a lot to teach <i>us</i> about democracy, they show how
it really works.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the point is, if
you can do it in Haiti, and if you can do it in El Salvador, you can
certainly do it right now in the United States&mdash;we are much
better off than those people.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you&rsquo;re
right, it&rsquo;s certainly not going to be a walk-over&mdash;but I
don&rsquo;t really see any reason why these things are beyond our
reach. And I should say that if they <i>are</i> beyond our reach,
we&rsquo;re all in trouble&mdash;<i>bad</i> trouble. Because if it
turns out that building genuine mass popular movements on an
international scale can&rsquo;t be done, it&rsquo;s not so obvious
that there will continue to be human civilization for very
long&mdash;because part of the whole capitalist ethic is that the
only thing that matters is how much money you make tomorrow: that&rsquo;s
the crucial value of the system, profit for tomorrow. Not just
profit, but the bottom line has to look good <i>tomorrow.</i> And the
result is that planning for the future, and any kind of regulatory
apparatus that would sustain the environment for the long-term,
become impossible&mdash;and that means the planet is going to go down
the tubes very fast.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, this was
just demonstrated kind of dramatically in the United States a little
while ago. Right as the &ldquo;Gingrich army&rdquo; was coming into
office in 1994 and describing how they&rsquo;re going to destroy the
country&rsquo;s environmental regulatory system, right at that very
same time a number of scientific reports of considerable significance
were released.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">85</font></sup>
One had to do with New England&mdash;or really, the world: it had to
do with the Georges Bank fishing ground, an offshore shelf off the
coast of New England. Georges Bank has always been the richest
fishing area in the world, and it remained so through the 1970s. But
in the 1980s, the Reaganites deregulated the fishing industry and at
the same time subsidized it&mdash;because that&rsquo;s how the &ldquo;free
market&rdquo; works: you deregulate so the industries can do anything
they want, and then the public pays them off to make sure they stay
in business. Well, when you deregulate and you subsidize the fishing
industry, it doesn&rsquo;t take a great genius to figure out what&rsquo;s
going to happen&mdash;what happened is, they wiped out the
ground-fish.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, now New
England is importing cod from Norway. Anybody from New England knows
what that means&mdash;it&rsquo;s unimaginable. And the reason we&rsquo;re
importing cod from Norway is that in Norway, they continued to
regulate  their fishing grounds; here we deregulated them, so of
course they were destroyed. So now a large part of Georges Bank is
closed off to fishing, and nobody knows if it can recover.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">86</font></sup>
Well, if they eliminate the rest of the country&rsquo;s regulatory
apparatus, it&rsquo;s going to be the same kind of thing all over the
place. So if this task of organizing a democratic society <i>does</i>
prove to be impossible, we&rsquo;re all going to be in very serious
trouble: very serious.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8774_2032848809"></a>Initial
Moves and the Coming Crisis<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Do you see
any steps being taken right now towards building these kinds of
international movements?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I think one
can see some things happening&mdash;and you can imagine them
extending to a much larger scale. Most of the things you see today
are so small that they&rsquo;re not really making an impact, but
they&rsquo;re real, and they could potentially become the start of
bigger things.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">For example, the
first shreds of any positive move in the union movement that I&rsquo;m
aware of occurred right after N.A.F.T.A. was passed [in 1993].
Immediately after the N.A.F.T.A. vote, like within weeks, General
Electric and Honeywell both fired workers for trying to organize
unions in their plants in Northern Mexico. Okay, normally when that
happens, that&rsquo;s the end of it. This time, for the first time
ever I think, two American unions, United Electrical Workers and the
Teamsters, intervened to defend the organizers and protested to the
Clinton administration. And they have some clout: they&rsquo;re not
like corporations, but they&rsquo;ve got a lot more power than
Mexican unions. I mean, there really <i>are no</i> Mexican unions,
because Mexico&rsquo;s like a fascist state&mdash;there&rsquo;s just
a government union (kind of like in the old Soviet Union) and then
essentially one other one, which of course opposed N.A.F.T.A. but is
under such terrific controls that it couldn&rsquo;t do anything. But
the big American unions still can&rsquo;t be completely ignored, and
in this case they were able to get the U.S. Labor Department to
investigate these firings in Mexico.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">87</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, the thing went
to a U.S. Labor Department panel, which was supposed to determine
whether there had in fact been an infringement of labor rights&mdash;and
of course Robert Reich&rsquo;s department discovered that there had
been no violations. What they said is, the fired workers had Mexican
law behind them, they still had legal recourse under Mexican law, so
therefore there was no issue for the U.S. Labor Department. I mean,
you have to <i>read</i> this thing&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know if any of
you are familiar with Mexican labor law, but this doesn&rsquo;t even
rise to the level of hilarity. But that was the decision, so the
firings went through. The fired workers are allowed to apply for
severance pay, very happy; I&rsquo;m sure G.E. is mourning.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">88</font></sup>
But at least in this case American unions got to the point of
defending the rights of Mexican workers for the first time&mdash;at
this point out of their own interests, because they  recognize
they&rsquo;re really getting crushed. But that&rsquo;s the kind of
thing that has to start taking place on a massive scale, if there are
going to be significant moves against these problems.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Beyond that, serious
changes in the economy will simply require dismantling private power
altogether&mdash;there just is no way around that in the end. And you
can even see some rudimentary steps towards it here and there, I
think. Weirton Steel was one recent effort [workers own a portion of
the company through an Employee Stock Ownership Plan]; and there are
others which could be turned into something meaningful. Even things
like the negotiations at United Airlines could be meaningful initial
steps, though ultimately it depends on whether the settlements are
just in terms of stock ownership by workers or actual employee
management, which would be something very different [United&rsquo;s
employees traded steep pay cuts for 55 percent ownership of the
company&rsquo;s stock and 3 of its 12 board seats in 1994].</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So the <i>methods</i>
for starting to move towards real change are quite clear, it&rsquo;s
just a question of whether enough people are willing to start
pursuing them. There are all sorts of options for how to begin
building popular movements, and they could be developed on a very
substantial scale. Then if they&rsquo;re coordinated, with genuine
community efforts to take control over whatever resources and
industries are within them, and they begin to link up
internationally, anything at all is possible, I think. I mean, sure,
the scale is enormous&mdash;but with any major social change the
scale has been enormous. You could raise the same doubts about the
women&rsquo;s movement, or getting rid of slavery in Haiti in 1790&mdash;it
must have looked impossible. There&rsquo;s nothing new about that
feeling.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: I just get
the sense that we&rsquo;re waiting for some ecological disaster
before people really start to get active in these movements on a
massive scale.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, if we wait for
an ecological disaster, it&rsquo;ll be too late&mdash;in fact, we
might not even have such a long wait.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, it&rsquo;s
certainly true that as the threats mount, it may energize people&mdash;but
you don&rsquo;t <i>wait</i> for that to happen: first you have to
prepare the ground. For example, suppose it was discovered tomorrow
that the greenhouse effect has been way underestimated, and that the
catastrophic effects are actually going to set in 10 years from now,
and not 100 years from now or something. Well, given the state of the
popular movements we have today, we&rsquo;d probably have a fascist
takeover&mdash;with everybody agreeing to it, because that would be
the only method for survival that anyone could think of. I&rsquo;d
even agree to it, because there just are no other alternatives around
right now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you don&rsquo;t
<i>wait</i> for the disasters to happen, first you have to create the
groundwork. You need to plant the seeds of something right now, so
that whatever opportunities happen to arise&mdash;whether it&rsquo;s
workers being fired  in Mexico, or an ecological catastrophe, or
anything else&mdash;people are in a position that they can do
something constructive about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: Dr. Chomsky,
I&rsquo;m actually wondering whether the corporate elites can&rsquo;t
turn the environmental crisis to their benefit&mdash;use it as a new
technique of taxpayer subsidy, another form of welfare like the
others you were describing? So now the public will pay them to
salvage the environment they&rsquo;ve been primarily responsible for
destroying?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Yeah, sure, you
don&rsquo;t even have to predict it&mdash;it&rsquo;s already been
happening. Take DuPont: they weren&rsquo;t all that upset about the
fact that they can no longer sell fluorocarbons [which destroy the
ozone layer and have been closely regulated since the late 1980s],
because now they can just get big public subsidies to produce other
things that will replace them.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">89</font></sup>
I mean, at least in this respect these people are rational, so they
are going to try to take advantage of whatever techniques happen to
be around to ensure that the public is forced to keep subsidizing
their profits. And if the environmental crisis reaches the point
where some changes have to be introduced&mdash;as it already <i>has</i>,
in fact&mdash;they&rsquo;ll be sure to profit off them.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, people are
really worried about the destruction of the ozone layer&mdash;even
the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> editors, who are usually out in space
on these issues, have started getting worried about it. I mean, it
wasn&rsquo;t so bad when it was just killing people in Chile and
Argentina who are near the South Pole [i.e. where the first hole in
the ozone layer was discovered], but when they detected another hole
over the Arctic in the north&mdash;meaning white people are going to
suffer someday&mdash;then even those guys finally noticed it.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">90</font></sup>
And when the ocean starts rising to the level of whatever building
they&rsquo;re in and whatever floor they&rsquo;re on as they write
their editorials, yeah, then they&rsquo;ll agree that there&rsquo;s a
greenhouse effect and we&rsquo;d better do something about it. Sure,
no matter how lunatic people are, at some point or other they&rsquo;re
going to realize that these problems exist, and they are approaching
fast. It&rsquo;s just that the next thing they&rsquo;ll ask is, &ldquo;So
how can we make some money off it?&rdquo; In fact, anybody in
business who <i>didn&rsquo;t</i> ask that question would find
themselves out of business&mdash;just because that&rsquo;s the way
that capitalist institutions work. I mean, if some executive came
along and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>not</i> going to look at it that
way, I&rsquo;m going to do things differently,&rdquo; well, they&rsquo;d
get replaced by someone who <i>would</i> try to make more money off
it&mdash;because these are simply institutional facts, these are
facts about the structure of the institutions. And if you don&rsquo;t
like them, and I don&rsquo;t, then you&rsquo;re going to have to
change the institutions. There really is no other way.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So yes, within the
framework of the institutions that currently exist, the environmental
crisis will be yet another technique of public subsidy to ensure
continued private profits, and they&rsquo;ll keep capitalizing on it
exactly as you describe.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8776_2032848809"></a>Elite
Planning&mdash;Slipping Out of Hand<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>MAN: How much of
this do you attribute to a conspiracy theory, and how much would you
say is just a by-product of capital near-sightedness and a shared
interest in holding on to power?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, this term
&ldquo;conspiracy theory&rdquo; is kind of an interesting one. For
example, if I was talking about Soviet planning and I said, &ldquo;Look,
here&rsquo;s what the Politburo decided, and then the Kremlin did
this,&rdquo; nobody would call that a &ldquo;conspiracy
theory&rdquo;&mdash;everyone would just assume that I was talking
about planning. But as soon as you start talking about anything
that&rsquo;s done by power in the <i>West</i>, then everybody calls
it a &ldquo;conspiracy theory.&rdquo; You&rsquo;re not allowed to
talk about planning in the West, it&rsquo;s not allowed to exist. So
if you&rsquo;re a political scientist, one of the things you
learn&mdash;you don&rsquo;t even make it into graduate school unless
you&rsquo;ve already internalized it&mdash;is that nobody here ever
plans anything: we just act out of a kind of general benevolence,
stumbling from here to here, sometimes making mistakes and so on. The
guys in power aren&rsquo;t idiots, after all. They do planning. In
fact, they do very careful and sophisticated planning. But anybody
who talks about it, and uses government records or anything else to
back it up, is into &ldquo;conspiracy theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s the same
with business: business is again just operating out of a generalized
benevolence, trying to help everybody get the cheapest goods with the
best quality, all this kind of stuff. If you say: &ldquo;Look,
Chrysler is trying to maximize profits and market share,&rdquo;
that&rsquo;s &ldquo;conspiracy theory.&rdquo; In other words, as soon
as you describe elementary reality and attribute minimal rationality
to people with power&mdash;well, that&rsquo;s fine as long as it&rsquo;s
an enemy, but if it&rsquo;s a part of domestic power, it&rsquo;s a
&ldquo;conspiracy theory&rdquo; and you&rsquo;re not supposed to talk
about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So, the first thing
I would suggest is, drop the term. There are really only two
questions. One is, how much of this is <i>conscious</i> planning&mdash;as
happens everywhere else. And the other is, how much is <i>bad</i>
planning?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, it&rsquo;s all
conscious planning: there is just no doubt that a lot of very
conscious planning goes on among intelligent people who are trying to
maximize their power. They&rsquo;d be insane if they didn&rsquo;t do
that. I mean, I&rsquo;m not telling you anything new when I tell you
that top editors, top government officials, and major businessmen
have meetings together&mdash;of course. And not only do they have
meetings, they belong to the same golf clubs, they go to the same
parties, they went to the same schools, they flow up and back from
one position to another in the government and private sector, and so
on and so forth. In other words, they represent the same social
class: they&rsquo;d be crazy if they didn&rsquo;t communicate and
plan with each other.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So <i>of course</i>
the Board of Directors of General Motors plans, the same way the
National Security Council plans, and the National Association of
Manufacturers&rsquo; P.R. agencies plan. I mean, this was a truism to
Adam  Smith: if you read Adam Smith [classical economist], he says
that every time two businessmen get together in a room, you can be
sure there&rsquo;s some plan being cooked up which is going to harm
the public. Yeah, how could it be otherwise? And there&rsquo;s
nothing particularly new about this&mdash;as Smith pointed out over
two hundred years ago, the &ldquo;masters of mankind,&rdquo; as he
called them, will do what they have to in order to follow &ldquo;the
vile maxim&rdquo;: &ldquo;all for ourselves and nothing for anyone
else.&rdquo; <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">91</font></sup>
Yeah, and when they&rsquo;re in the National Security Council, or the
Business Roundtable [a national organization composed of the C.E.O.s
of 200 major corporations], or the rest of these elite planning
forums, they have extreme power behind them. And yes, they&rsquo;re
planning&mdash;planning very carefully.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, the only
significant question to ask is, is it <i>intelligent</i> planning?
Okay, that depends on what the goals are. If the goals are to
maximize corporate profits for tomorrow, then it&rsquo;s very
intelligent planning. If the goals are to have a world where your
children can survive, then it&rsquo;s completely idiotic. But that
second thing really isn&rsquo;t a part of the game. In fact, it&rsquo;s
institutionalized: it&rsquo;s not that these people are stupid, it&rsquo;s
that to the extent that you have a competitive system based on
private control over resources, you are forced to maximize short-term
gain. That&rsquo;s just an institutional necessity.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">I mean, suppose
there were three car companies: Chrysler, General Motors, and Ford.
And suppose that one of them decided to put its resources into
producing fuel-efficient, user-friendly cars which could be available
ten years from now, and which would have a much less destructive
impact on the environment&mdash;suppose Ford decided to put a
proportion of its resources into that. Well, Chrysler <i>wouldn&rsquo;t</i>
be putting its resources into that, which means that they would
undersell Ford today, and Ford wouldn&rsquo;t be in the game ten
years from now. Well, that&rsquo;s just the nature of a competitive
system&mdash;and that&rsquo;s exactly why if you&rsquo;re a manager
you&rsquo;ve got to try to make sure that in the next financial
quarter your bottom line shows something good, whatever effects it
may have a year from now: that&rsquo;s just part of the institutional
irrationality of the system.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, here I must
say I would like to complain about a recent cover of <i>Z Magazine.</i>
I had an article in there, and on the cover there was the title:
&ldquo;Corporate Greed.&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s just an absurd
phrase.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">92</font></sup> I
mean, to talk about &ldquo;corporate greed&rdquo; is like talking
about &ldquo;military weapons&rdquo; or something like that&mdash;there
just is no other possibility. A corporation is something that is
trying to maximize power and profit: that&rsquo;s what it <i>is.</i>
There is no &ldquo;phenomenon&rdquo; of corporate greed, and we
shouldn&rsquo;t mislead people into thinking there is. It&rsquo;s
like talking about &ldquo;robber&rsquo;s greed&rdquo; or something
like that&mdash;it&rsquo;s not a meaningful thing, it&rsquo;s
misleading. A corporation&rsquo;s purpose is to maximize profit and
market share and return to investors, and all that kind of stuff, and
if its officers <i>don&rsquo;t</i> pursue that goal, for one thing
they are legally liable for not pursuing it. There I agree with
Milton Friedman [right-wing economist] and those guys: if you&rsquo;re
a C.E.O., you must do that&mdash;otherwise you&rsquo;re in
dereliction of duty, in fact dereliction of official  legal duty.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">93</font></sup>
And besides that, if you don&rsquo;t do it, you&rsquo;ll get kicked
out by the shareholders or the Board of Directors, and you won&rsquo;t
be there very long anyway.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So in a sense the
planning is &ldquo;bad,&rdquo; if you like&mdash;like it&rsquo;s
stupid to destroy Georges Bank if you&rsquo;re thinking about five
years from now. But it&rsquo;s <i>not</i> stupid if you&rsquo;re
thinking of tomorrow&rsquo;s profits. And I think the question we
need to ask is, which of those things are we concerned about?</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, it&rsquo;s
interesting to look at the history of the government regulatory
system in the United States in this context&mdash;things like the
I.C.C. [Interstate Commerce Commission] and so on. Keep in mind that
these governmental regulatory agencies were mostly instituted by
business itself, particularly capital-intensive,
internationally-oriented big business&mdash;because they recognized
that the predatory nature of capitalism was just going to destroy
everything if they didn&rsquo;t bring it under control somehow. So
they <i>wanted</i> regulation to keep things kind of organized&mdash;just
like they wanted labor unions, and they wanted the New Deal programs.
In fact, if you look at many of the things that have really improved
the country, like the New Deal programs in the 1930s, for example
(which at least partially brought the United States into the main
framework of industrial societies with respect to social programs), a
lot of the drive behind them was coming from big business, as opposed
to small business.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">See, big
corporations like General Electric and so on&mdash;which are
capital-intensive, and have relatively small labor forces and an
international orientation&mdash;they supported the New Deal measures.
It was more mainstream businesses who opposed the New Deal, like
medium-level industry, members of the National Association of
Manufacturers and so on&mdash;because they weren&rsquo;t
capital-intensive, and they had large labor forces, and didn&rsquo;t
sell to international markets, therefore they didn&rsquo;t benefit
particularly from New Deal programs. But for a big corporation like
G.E., it was better to have an organized workforce that wouldn&rsquo;t
carry out wildcat strikes, and that you could be sure was going to
work pretty regularly even if you had to pay them a little bit more,
and so on and so forth.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">94</font></sup>
That&rsquo;s also why big business has tended to support the
existence of unions&mdash;American-style unions&mdash;to a certain
extent: because they know the system&rsquo;s going to self-destruct
if there aren&rsquo;t devices around to bring things under control.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">As a matter of fact,
one aspect of the recent shift we&rsquo;ve seen in American politics
is that big business is <i>not</i> in such good shape in this
respect. The guys who took over Congress in 1994 are <i>not</i>
pro-big business in this way&mdash;they are not the sort of people
who want an organized, planned society. See, big business is kind of
Communist: they want a powerful state organizing things in their
long-term interests. And the guys who came into power with Newt
Gingrich in 1994 are a somewhat different breed. They&rsquo;re more
like the old National Association of Manufacturers-types who opposed
the New Deal, and there&rsquo;s also this freakish fundamentalist
element among them, which is extremely powerful in the United States.
I  mean, this is not so much true of Gingrich himself&mdash;Gingrich
is sort of more reasonable, he&rsquo;s just a flak for big business.
But the people he organized are fanatics, especially what they call
the &ldquo;Christian Right&rdquo;&mdash;they&rsquo;re people who want
money tomorrow, they don&rsquo;t care what happens to the world two
inches down the road, they don&rsquo;t care what happens to anybody
else, they&rsquo;re deeply irrational. And they&rsquo;re
totalitarian: despite what they say, they in fact want a very
powerful state, but only to order people around and tell them how to
live, and to throw them in jail if they step the wrong way, and so
on, a National Security State basically. Well, that&rsquo;s a real
basis for fascism&mdash;and big business and a lot of other powerful
people are very worried about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, if you
looked at the funding for the whole Gingrich movement, it was quite
interesting. The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> had an article on it
after the Congressional elections in 1994, and it turned out that the
main people who were funding them were at the fringes of the economy:
I think the biggest funder was Amway [a direct-sales company somewhat
like a pyramid scheme], which is basically a scam operation, and the
other big ones were things like &ldquo;hedge funds&rdquo;&mdash;not
the real brokerage houses, but the ones around the fringe of Wall
Street who lend you huge amounts of money for very risky loans. And
then there was lots of money coming from gun interests, and alcohol
interests, and gambling interests, and so on. I mean, these are
sectors of business where there&rsquo;s a ton of money, but they are
not really a part of the mainstream economy. The Gingrich group
wasn&rsquo;t getting its funding from General Electric, let&rsquo;s
say. In fact, the only big corporation that was funding them was
Philip Morris [a cigarette manufacturer], and the guys at Philip
Morris are mass murderers, so they need government protection and
yeah, they&rsquo;ll fund Newt Gingriches.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">95</font></sup>
But if you look at who was really backing them, it&rsquo;s mostly
what are called &ldquo;small businessmen&rdquo;&mdash;they&rsquo;re
people in the top two percent of income levels, let&rsquo;s say,
instead of the top one-half percent; they&rsquo;re what&rsquo;s
referred to as &ldquo;Main Street,&rdquo; like their businesses have
about fifty employees or something like that. Well, those people
really <i>do</i> want the government out of their hair, they don&rsquo;t
want a lot of regulations holding them back from making as much money
as they can.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Just to give you an
example, there&rsquo;s a contractor painting my house right now, and
I&rsquo;ve been talking to him&mdash;<i>he&rsquo;s</i> the kind of
guy they represent. He hates the government, because the government
doesn&rsquo;t let him use lead in the paint, and it makes him pay
workers&rsquo; compensation to his workers when they get hurt, things
like that. He just wants to get all this stuff out of his hair so he
can go out there and make money, do whatever he feels like. You tell
him, &ldquo;Well, kids will die of lead poisoning if you use leaded
paint.&rdquo; He says, &ldquo;Ahh, a lot of government bureaucrats
made that up, what do they know? I&rsquo;ve been breathing lead all
my life and look at me, I&rsquo;m healthy as a horse.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s
the sort of attitude that&rsquo;s been supporting this movement&mdash;and
I think big business is very worried about it.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">If you want to get a
sense of what it&rsquo;s like, <i>Fortune</i> magazine in its
February &rsquo;95 issue had a cover-story on the attitudes of
C.E.O.s towards what&rsquo;s been going on in Washington. These guys
are worried&mdash;and the reason why they&rsquo;re worried is quite
simple: these C.E.O.s are what&rsquo;s called &ldquo;liberal.&rdquo;
I mean, they love the fact that wages are going down, and that
profits are shooting through the roof, and that environmental laws
are being loosened, and that welfare is being cut&mdash;all that
stuff is just great to them. But if you look at some of their
personal attitudes, they&rsquo;re about as far away from the
Christian Right as the Harvard faculty is.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">96</font></sup>
They are militantly pro-abortion on demand. They believe in women&rsquo;s
rights&mdash;like, they want their daughters to have career
opportunities. They don&rsquo;t want their kids to have to study
Lucifer and Beast 666 in school. They don&rsquo;t want maniacs
running around with assault rifles because the black helicopters are
bringing aliens in, or whatever the latest frenzy is. But the troops
that they&rsquo;ve mobilized are in that domain. The so-called
Christian Right, for one, just have a different agenda. And I think
big business is worried about them: the C.E.O.s don&rsquo;t want <i>that</i>
kind of fascism. And that&rsquo;s why by now, if you take a look,
you&rsquo;ll see that big corporations have tended to line up with
the Clinton administration.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Take something like
science policy. These &ldquo;Gingrich army&rdquo;-types don&rsquo;t
see any point in science&mdash;it&rsquo;s just a bunch of
pointy-headed intellectuals, who needs that? On the other hand, big
corporations understand that if they want to keep making profits five
years from now, there&rsquo;d better be some science being funded
today&mdash;and of course, they don&rsquo;t want to pay for it
themselves, they want the public to pay for it, through university
science departments and so on. They want the government to keep
funding science, so when some discovery comes along they can then rip
it off and make the money off it. Well, just a little while ago, a
bunch of the big corporate heads wrote a joint letter to the House
science committee asking them to continue high levels of funding for
university-based science and research programs&mdash;just the thing
the Republican Congress wants to cut&mdash;because their job <i>isn&rsquo;t</i>
just to pour lead paint on somebody&rsquo;s house: these guys know
that they are not going to be in the game a couple years from now
unless U.S. science continues to produce things for them to exploit.
So by this point, they are getting very worried that these Newt
Gingrich-types might go too far and start cutting down the parts of
the state system that are welfare for <i>them</i>&mdash;which of
course is unacceptable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">What&rsquo;s
happened is actually pretty intriguing, if you think about it. I
mean, for the past fifty years American business has been organizing
a major class war, and they needed troops&mdash;there <i>are</i>
votes after all, and you can&rsquo;t just come before the electorate
and say, &ldquo;Vote for me, I&rsquo;m trying to screw you.&rdquo; So
what they&rsquo;ve had to do is appeal to the population on some
other grounds. Well, there aren&rsquo;t a lot of other grounds, and
everybody always picks the same ones, whether his name is Hitler or
anything else&mdash;jingoism, racism, fear, religious fundamentalism:
these are the ways of appealing  to people if you&rsquo;re trying to
organize a mass base of support for policies that are really intended
to crush them. And they&rsquo;ve done it, business had to do it&mdash;and
now after fifty years they&rsquo;ve got a tiger by the tail.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, the German
businessmen who supported Hitler were probably thinking about the
same thing in 1937 and &rsquo;38. They&rsquo;d been perfectly happy
to pay off the Nazis to organize the population on the basis of fear,
hatred, racism, and jingoism, in order to beat down the German labor
movement and kill off the Communists there&mdash;but of course, once
the Nazis got into power, they had their own agenda. The big
industrialists in Germany did <i>not</i> want a war with the West&mdash;but
by then it was too late.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Now, I don&rsquo;t
want to say that this is Nazi Germany, but there is a similarity&mdash;just
as there&rsquo;s a similarity to post-Khomeini Iran. I mean, Iranian
business strongly opposed the Shah [the Iranian monarch who ruled the
country until 1979], because they didn&rsquo;t like the fact that he
controlled the state monopolies, especially the National Iranian Oil
Company&mdash;and as a result they wanted to see him overthrown, and
they needed somebody to do it. Well, the only forces they could
appeal to were the movements in the streets, and those guys were
being organized by fundamentalist clerics. So as a result they
overthrew the Shah alright, but they also got Khomeini and all these
fundamentalist maniacs running around, which they didn&rsquo;t like.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, something
similar has been happening in the United States and people are
worried about it. Incidentally, I think this is also why we&rsquo;re
now starting to get editorials in the <i>New York Times</i> defending
the counter-culture. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">97</font></sup>
And just to tell you a personal thing, recently there was a favorable
review of a book of mine in the <i>Boston Globe.</i> That is
unbelievable. <sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">98</font></sup>
I mean, it couldn&rsquo;t <i>possibly</i> have happened a couple
years ago. There have even been some discussions in the press of
&ldquo;class war&rdquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s a concept that is usually
unmentionable in the U.S.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">99</font></sup>
And I think it&rsquo;s because a lot of elites are really running
scared these days. They think: &ldquo;Look, we&rsquo;ve unleashed the
demon&mdash;now it&rsquo;s going to go after the interests of really
rich people.&rdquo; The only way they&rsquo;ve been able to keep
their power is by waging a huge propaganda war, and that has now
brought up guys who are like suicide bombers, and who think that
women ought to be driven back to the home and shut up, and who want
to have twelve assault rifles in their closets, and so on. Well, they
don&rsquo;t like that, and now they&rsquo;re starting to get scared.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8778_2032848809"></a>Disturbed
Populations Stirring<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: How do you
think it&rsquo;s all going to play out, then&mdash;do you see the
American political system heading for a civil war?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, in general I
don&rsquo;t think you can make predictions like that&mdash;when we
talk about predictions, we&rsquo;re just talking about intuitions,
and mine are  no better than anybody else&rsquo;s. But I do feel this
period is kind of a turning point. I mean, you can see very clearly
where policy is driving people, and you know exactly what its goals
are. The only question you can&rsquo;t answer is how the population
is going to react as they get slammed in the face&mdash;and they <i>are</i>
getting slammed in the face. One way it could go would be like the
building of the C.I.O. [an integrated mass union formed in 1935], or
the Civil Rights and feminist movements, or the Freedom Rides [whites
and blacks rode buses together into the American South in 1961 to
challenge segregation laws]. Other ways it could go would be Nazism,
Khomeini&rsquo;s Iran, Islamic fundamentalism in Algeria&mdash;those
are all ways people could go too.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">But the country is
very disturbed. You can see it in polls, and you can certainly see it
traveling around&mdash;and I travel around a lot. There&rsquo;s
complete disaffection about everything. People don&rsquo;t trust
anyone, they think everyone&rsquo;s lying to them, everyone&rsquo;s
working for somebody else. The whole civil society has completely
broken down. And when you talk about the mood of people&mdash;well,
whether it&rsquo;s on right-wing talk radio, or among students, or
just among the general population, you get a very good reception
these days for the kinds of things I talk about. But it&rsquo;s
scary&mdash;because if you came and told people, &ldquo;Clinton&rsquo;s
organizing a U.N. army with aliens to come and carry out genocide,
you&rsquo;d better go to the hills,&rdquo; you&rsquo;d get the same
favorable response. That&rsquo;s the problem&mdash;you&rsquo;d get
the same favorable response. I mean, you can go to the most
reactionary parts of the country, or anywhere else, and a thousand
people will show up to listen, and they&rsquo;ll be really excited
about what you&rsquo;re saying&mdash;no matter what it is. That&rsquo;s
the trouble: it&rsquo;s <i>no matter what it is.</i> Because people
are so disillusioned by this point that they will believe almost
anything.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Take these guys in
what are called the &ldquo;militias&rdquo;&mdash;I mean, obviously
they&rsquo;re not militias in the Second Amendment sense: &ldquo;militias&rdquo;
are things raised by states, these are just paramilitary
organizations.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">100</font></sup>
But if you look at who&rsquo;s involved in them, they are people from
a sector of the population that has really gotten it in the neck in
the last twenty years: they&rsquo;re high school graduates, mostly
white males, a segment of the society that has really taken a
beating. I mean, median real wages in the United States have dropped
about 20 percent since 1973&mdash;that&rsquo;s a substantial cut.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">101</font></sup>
Their wives now have to go to work just to put food on the table.
Often their families have broken up. Their kids are running wild, but
there&rsquo;s no social support system anywhere to help them deal
with that. They don&rsquo;t read the &ldquo;<i>Fortune</i> 500&rdquo;
and put together an analysis of what&rsquo;s really going on in the
world, all they&rsquo;ve had rammed into their heads is, &ldquo;The
federal government&rsquo;s your enemy.&rdquo; If you come to them
with a political framework that could lead to some kind of productive
change, it&rsquo;s all just another power-play as far as they&rsquo;re
concerned&mdash;and with some justice: everything else they&rsquo;ve
been told is a crock, so why should they believe you? You tell them
to read declassified National Security Council documents, or to look
at  things in the business press that would really mean something to
them&mdash;I mean, a lot of people don&rsquo;t even read. We should
bear in mind how illiterate the society&rsquo;s become. It&rsquo;s
tough.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So these groups
certainly represent something: they&rsquo;re a response to sharply
worsening conditions. I mean, they&rsquo;re called &ldquo;right-wing,&rdquo;
but in my view they&rsquo;re sort of independent of politics&mdash;there
could be people on the left in there too. All of this is not so
different from people believing conspiracy theories about Kennedy&rsquo;s
assassination, or about the Trilateral Commission [an elite
think-tank], or the C.I.A. and all the rest of that stuff&mdash;the
things that are just tearing the left to shreds.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Or take this guy
called the &ldquo;Unabomber&rdquo; [a serial mail-bomb killer who
espoused an anti-industrial worldview]. When I read his manifesto, I
thought, if I don&rsquo;t know him, I know his friends&mdash;they&rsquo;re
the kind of people I run into on the left all the time. They&rsquo;re
demoralized, they&rsquo;re fed up, they&rsquo;re desperate, but they
don&rsquo;t have a constructive response to all the problems we&rsquo;ve
got to face. Then again, the L.A. riots [in 1992] also weren&rsquo;t
a constructive response. In fact, all these reactions, from the
&ldquo;militias,&rdquo; to conspiracy theories, to the Unabomber, to
the L.A. riots, they&rsquo;re all the result of a kind of collapse of
civil society in the United States. The vestiges of an integrated,
socially cohesive, functioning society, with some kind of solidarity
and continuity to it, have just been destroyed here. It&rsquo;s hard
to imagine a better way to demoralize people than to have them watch
T.V. for seven hours a day&mdash;but that&rsquo;s pretty much what
people have been reduced to by now.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">In fact, all of
these things really illustrate the difference between completely
demoralized societies like ours and societies that are still kind of
hanging together, like in a lot of the Third World. I mean, in
absolute terms the Mayan Indians in Chiapas, Mexico [who organized
the Zapatista rebellion in 1994], are much poorer than the people in
South Central Los Angeles, or in Michigan or Montana&mdash;much
poorer. But they have a civil society that hasn&rsquo;t been totally
eliminated the way the working-class culture we used to have in the
United States was. Chiapas is one of the most impoverished areas of
the Hemisphere, but because there&rsquo;s still a lively, vibrant
society there, with a cultural tradition of freedom and social
organization, the Mayan Indian peasants were able to respond in a
highly constructive way&mdash;they organized the Chiapas rebellion,
they have programs and positions, they have public support, it&rsquo;s
been going somewhere. South Central Los Angeles, on the other hand,
was just a riot: it was the reaction of a completely demoralized,
devastated, poor working-class population, with nothing at all to
bring it together. All the people could do there was mindless lashing
out, just go steal from the stores. The only effect of that is, we&rsquo;ll
build more jails.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So to answer your
question, I think it&rsquo;s very much up in the air what&rsquo;s
going to happen in the United States. See, there&rsquo;s an
experiment going on. The experiment is: can you marginalize a large
part of the population, regard  them as superfluous because they&rsquo;re
not helping you make those dazzling profits&mdash;and can you set up
a world in which production is carried out by the most oppressed
people, with the fewest rights, in the most flexible labor markets,
for the happiness of the rich people of the world? Can you do that?
Can you get women in China to work locked into factories where
they&rsquo;re burned to death in fires, producing toys that are sold
in stores in New York and Boston so that rich people can buy them for
their children at Christmas?<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">102</font></sup>
Can you have an economy where everything works like that&mdash;production
by the most impoverished and exploited, for the richest and most
privileged, internationally? And with large parts of the general
population just marginalized because they don&rsquo;t contribute to
the system&mdash;in Colombia, murdered, in New York, locked up in
prison. Can you do that? Well, nobody knows the answer to that
question. You ask, could it lead to a civil war? It definitely could,
it could lead to uprisings, revolts.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8780_2032848809"></a>The
Verge of Fascism<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And there are other
things to worry about too, like the fact that the United States is
such an extremely fundamentalist country&mdash;and also such an
unusually frightened one. I mean, we became kind of a laughingstock
to the rest of the world during the 1980s: every time Reagan would
announce some Libyan terrorist action or something, the entire
tourism industry in Europe would collapse, because everybody in the
United States was afraid to go to Europe&mdash;where they&rsquo;re
about a hundred times as safe as in any American city&mdash;for fear
there might be some Arab lurking around the corners there trying to
kill them. That&rsquo;s literally the case, it became a real joke
around the world&mdash;and it&rsquo;s just another sign of how much
extreme irrationality and fear there is in the U.S. population.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">And that&rsquo;s a
very dangerous phenomenon&mdash;because that kind of deep
irrationality can readily be whipped up by demagogues, you know, Newt
Gingriches. These guys can whip up fear, hatred, they can appeal to
fundamentalist urges&mdash;and that&rsquo;s been scaring most of the
world for a while, I should say. For example, if you recall the
Republican National Convention in 1992, it opened with a &ldquo;God
and Country&rdquo; rally, which was televised and seen around the
world. In Europe particularly it really sent chills up people&rsquo;s
spines&mdash;because they remember Hitler&rsquo;s Nuremberg rallies,
at least older people do, and it had something of that tone. Well,
the Republicans were able to insulate the Convention from it that
time around and keep most of that stuff confined to the first night,
but in the future they might not be able to do that&mdash;in the
future those people might take the Convention over, in which case
we&rsquo;d be very close to some American version of fascism; it may
not be Hitler Germany, but it&rsquo;ll be bad enough.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">It&rsquo;s in fact a
very similar situation: Germany in the 1930s was maybe the most
civilized and advanced country in the world, though with plenty of
problems, and it was quite possible there to whip up hatred and fear,
to mobilize people, and in fact to carry out what from their point of
view was social development&mdash;with consequences that you&rsquo;re
familiar with. Yeah, why are we different? We&rsquo;ve got the same
genes, and the conditions in the culture which might be a part of the
background for it certainly already exist.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Actually, I think
that the United States has been in kind of a pre-fascist mood for
years&mdash;and we&rsquo;ve been very lucky that every leader who&rsquo;s
come along has been a crook. See, people should always be very much
in favor of corruption&mdash;I&rsquo;m not kidding about that.
Corruption&rsquo;s a very good thing, because it undermines power. I
mean, if we get some Jim Bakker coming along&mdash;you know, this
preacher who was caught sleeping with everybody and defrauding his
followers&mdash;those guys are fine: all they want is money and sex
and ripping people off, so they&rsquo;re never going to cause much
trouble. Or take Nixon, say: an obvious crook, he&rsquo;s ultimately
not going to cause that much of a problem. But if somebody shows up
who&rsquo;s kind of a Hitler-type&mdash;just wants power, no
corruption, straight, makes it all sound appealing, and says, &ldquo;We
want power&rdquo;&mdash;well, then we&rsquo;ll all be in very bad
trouble. Now, we haven&rsquo;t had the right person yet in the United
States, but sooner or later somebody&rsquo;s going to fill that
position&mdash;and if so, it will be highly dangerous.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">On the other hand,
though, I think you can also imagine things going quite differently.
The situation just is very pliable at this point in the United
States. I mean, these same guys who are blowing up Oklahoma City
government buildings [in 1995] could be doing what they would have
been doing sixty years ago, which is organizing the C.I.O.&mdash;the
same guys. It really just depends on whether people start doing
something about it. And there are also other things here that are
very healthy as well, and can be built on. For instance, there&rsquo;s
a streak of independence and opposition to authority in the United
States which probably is unique in the world. Obviously it can show
up in anti-social ways, like running around with assault rifles and
so on. But it can show up in very healthy ways too, and the trick is
to make it show up in the healthy ways, like opposition to
illegitimate authority.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So you know, it&rsquo;s
complicated. Could there be a civil war? It could be very unpleasant.
A lot of very ugly things could happen, they&rsquo;re not
inconceivable. But they&rsquo;re also not inevitable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: I&rsquo;ve
often heard you end talks by saying basically, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t
give up hope.&rdquo; But do you really see any hope&mdash;for the
future of democracy, or for the United States, or for the people in
the Third World?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, I&rsquo;ll
quote my friend Mike Albert [co-editor of <i>Z Magazine</i>], who was
listening to one of my gloomy disquisitions and said: &ldquo;You
know, what you&rsquo;re describing is an organizer&rsquo;s dream.&rdquo;
And I think that&rsquo;s true. The country is in a state where people
are disillusioned, frightened, skeptical,  angry, don&rsquo;t trust
anything, want something better, know that everything&rsquo;s rotten.
That&rsquo;s a perfect place for organizers to come and say, &ldquo;Okay,
let&rsquo;s do something about it. If they could do something about
it in the hills of El Salvador, we can certainly do something about
it here.&rdquo; And I think he&rsquo;s right: it just depends whether
you decide it&rsquo;s time to start doing something about it.</p>

<h1 class="western"><a name="__RefHeading___Toc8782_2032848809"></a>The
Future of History<i> </i>
</h1>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><i>WOMAN: But what
do you think personally, Noam&mdash;will the general population of
the United States remain marginalized for the rest of history, or do
you actually feel that there&rsquo;s going to be a movement to
prevent that?</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%"><br/>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Look, I really don&rsquo;t
know, but I think we can predict one thing with fair certainty: if
the U.S. public remains marginalized, there isn&rsquo;t going to be
much history left to worry about. We&rsquo;re not living in the
eighteenth century anymore. The problems may be sort of similar, but
they&rsquo;re quite different in scale, and the problems now have to
do with human survival. So if the general population in the most
powerful country in the world remains marginalized, we aren&rsquo;t
going to have to worry very much about history, because there isn&rsquo;t
going to be any. And that&rsquo;s not very far away at this point.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Take Central
America, which is the region where we have the most control&mdash;we&rsquo;ve
been controlling things there for a hundred years, so it really tells
us what we are. It&rsquo;s quite possible that much of Central
America will become uninhabitable in another couple decades. For
instance, Nicaragua&rsquo;s losing its water supply. Why? The reason
is, in the aftermath of the American attacks of the 1980s, people are
starving, and they&rsquo;re doing the only thing they can do&mdash;they
go up into the hills to cut wood and try to find some land to work,
they do whatever they can do to survive. Well, that eliminates the
forest cover, streams start drying up, the land can&rsquo;t absorb
water, lakes are drying up, and on top of it all, there happens to
have been a drought. So Nicaragua&rsquo;s water supply may
disappear&mdash;and as the pressures continue, it may become a
desert. The same could be true of Haiti.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">103</font></sup></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Haiti, in fact, is a
parable of Western savagery. That was one of the first places
Columbus landed, and he thought it was a paradise&mdash;it was the
richest place in the world, and also probably the most densely
populated place in the world. And in fact, it remained that way:
France is a rich country in large measure because it stole Haiti&rsquo;s
resources, and even early in the twentieth century, before Woodrow
Wilson sent the U.S. Marines to invade and wreck the country in 1915,
American scholarship and government studies on Haiti were still
describing it as a major resource center&mdash;it just happened to be
an extremely rich place.<sup><font size="1" style="font-size: 8pt">104</font></sup>
Well, take a look if you fly into Haiti today. The island consists of
Haiti and the Dominican Republic&mdash;the Dominican Republic we&rsquo;ve
also brutalized, but Haiti much more so&mdash;and you  can just see
it if you look down from the plane: on one side it&rsquo;s brown, on
the other side it&rsquo;s sort of semi-green. The brown side is
Haiti, the richest place in the world. It may not last another couple
decades&mdash;literally it may become uninhabitable.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">Well, that&rsquo;s
extending elsewhere now, and it involves us too. The rich and the
powerful are going to survive longer, but the effects are very
real&mdash;and they&rsquo;re getting worse very quickly as more and
more people get marginalized because they play no role in
profit-making, which is considered the only human value. Well, the
environmental problems are simply much more significant in scale than
anything else in the past. And there&rsquo;s a fair
possibility&mdash;certainly a possibility high enough so that no
rational person would exclude it&mdash;that within a couple hundred
years the world&rsquo;s water-level will have risen to the point that
most of human life will have been destroyed. Alright, if we don&rsquo;t
start to do something about that now, it&rsquo;s not impossible that
that&rsquo;ll happen. In fact, it&rsquo;s even likely.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 115%">So whatever <i>I</i>
happen to think, that&rsquo;s irrelevant. The answer to your question
is: if you remain marginalized, there&rsquo;s not going to be much
history to worry about. Whether people will react or not, who knows?
You know? Everyone&rsquo;s got to decide.</p>
